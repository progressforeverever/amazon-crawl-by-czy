第1条评论: I was so sorry to finish the series. The books were wonderful, and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Cixin Liu is the most incredibly imaginative author I have ever read.
第2条评论: If you didn't read Book 1, then this book cannot help you. Go read Book 1.Suffice it to say, this sequel to the original (Three Body Problem) lives up to the original's achievement.
第3条评论: Book for gift
第4条评论: A great exposition on asymmetric power. The dark forest is an interesting thought experiment. It brings to mind the question that vexes SETI: given how big the universe is, where is everybody? Maybe they're all just smart enough to be keeping to themselves. 😀
第5条评论: This is a complex story built on good science and engineering, speculation and suspense.  It focuses on human nature and human reactions to crisis and provides a variety of well-rounded characters. I enjoyed both books in the series very much and respect the science and science fiction roots of the epic.  Unlike most modern science fiction, it's length was appropriate and not the result of weak editing.
第6条评论: Changed by life it good
第7条评论: This book haunted me for months after I finished it. This transcends the first book - it is one of the most imaginative, clever, and thought-provoking books I've ever read.
第8条评论: Really really good follow up to The Three Body Problem. I cannot wait for the third book to be released now. When you learn what the "Dark Forest" refers to, you'll be marking this book 5 stars as well. So interesting.. and you'll laugh maniacally along with the last remaining Wallfacer when you his Wallfacer plan is finally unveiled.
第9条评论: If ever their was a book that managed to weave all branches of thought so harmoniously into a story this book is it.
第10条评论: More fiction than science. Lulls you into one guy's life, and earth's complacency. Then wrecks both in under a minute. Long buildup for jarring payoff.
第11条评论: The book has an interesting explanation of the Fermi paradox, contained in its own title. Central hero is also amazing.
第12条评论: Its a head trip.
第13条评论: Just started.  It's good though.
第14条评论: Book 2 of the trilogy. A must read for the trilogy.
第15条评论: Eagerly awaiting the translation of book 3 in this series. Good stuff!
第16条评论: On the human race and on earth
第17条评论: By far the best of the Trilogy! Thought provoking. Very well written. Great characters. A must buy! M G C
第18条评论: I never saw the end coming. It was surprising and a bit awe-inspiring. I'm definitely interested in reading more by this author.
第19条评论: great book, probably my favorite of the three
第20条评论: Story was great, I thought the translation wasn't as good as The Three Body Problem.
第21条评论: Slow to start but second half is very strong. Intriguing, frightening. A book I couldn’t stop thinking about as it headed toward the conclusion.
第22条评论: Greatly enjoyed this followup to Three Body Problem. Interesting twists and a fast read hard to stay away from. Recommend
第23条评论: Some very interesting Chinese nuances and differences assert themselves in what is otherwise a stimulating albeit at times punctuated narrative. Curious to read the next volume since the invasion was rather unconvincingly called off.
第24条评论: Combines engaging individual stories spanning centuries with the most imaginative (and numerous) science fiction and futuristic sociologic concepts I have read in years.  Describes humanity's darkest and most hopeful aspects in a totally unique way.
第25条评论: Absolutely exceptional world building. Marries extremely detailed, hard SciFi with wonderfully imagined characters.  Can’t wait to start the third book.
第26条评论: One of my favorite book series I’ve ever read. The entire 3 book series is so hard to put down. If you like science fiction, this is a must read!
第27条评论: I have been an avid reader and collector of wisdom for over 60 years and have earned my living as a writer. The Dark Forest and it’s accompanying books are among the most significant and well conceived I have ever read. Hats off to Mr Lou and his English translator. The thoughts expressed herein should be considered by every human in every region and country.
第28条评论: What a wonderful story! Can't imagine what a follow-up book found cover, but certainly hope to see one. Cannot wait for the Netflix movie!
第29条评论: If you're a fan of hard sci-fi and some great application of science to story telling then this book is for you.Liu develops a cast of believable characters who generally fit into a category that you're familiar with as a reader and then does some interesting things with them once they've been established. Without ruining the progression of ideas he reveals throughout, I simply urge you to start with the first book in the series - The Three Body Problem - and then come enjoy The Dark Forest.This book is worth the time.
第30条评论: Like the science fiction of Asimov, “The Dark Forest” combines interesting characters, exceptional pacing, and big ideas. I highly recommend it.
第31条评论: This is a very interesting take on Fermi's Paradox.  One of the most engrossing sci-fi books I've read.  You need to read "The Three-body Problem" first, which is decent in its own right, but really just a setup for this story, which is amazing.  The 3rd book is also fantastic.
第32条评论: I liked the way the author let the characters be themselves. If they are villains, they do not announce it. Or fools, or wise. You have to read, and think as you read, to really grasp where the story is heading.This is science fiction at its best.
第33条评论: Not a fan of the narrators voice or reading style. Especially from what I got used to from the first audio book. Still good and enjoyable story and read.
第34条评论: this is the middle book of a new trilogy, Written by a Chinese author it addresses common scifi convention with a completely fresh and incfedibly imaginative mindset. Not one story, but several interlocking ones, each one filled with fresh imagination of situations that we have seen many times before. After reading the first novel, this one is more focused and clear, more linear in its development. Wonderful, cant wait for the conclusion.
第35条评论: Oh yes. I can't say much without spoilers but I will say that if you start to wonder where the heck this is ever going to go, KEEP GOING. I did NOT see the end coming, although I anticipated a lot of the plot twists with the Three-Body Problem. I was so pleased to be surprised this time. I am on pins and needles waiting for book 3.
第36条评论: I've read a lot of science fiction, so I don't say that lightly. There are so many brilliant concepts here, and they're beautifully woven together in a fascinating and suspenseful storyline. No words are wasted on meandering or pointless side plots. The book presents a dark but profound and utterly compelling picture of the universe. Where The Three-Body Problem's characters were a little flat, The Dark Forest's characters are full-bodied and richly human. So stop reading this review and go buy the book.
第37条评论: Overall a good book and I'm looking forward to the next one.  However, I feel like a few story threads were dropped for too long only to be somewhat sloppily picked back up later.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.
第38条评论: The texture of literary style and story is sparsely dry and moistly verdant all at once. The work provides excellent exercise for our minds in a very real doom time.
第39条评论: The second in this trilogy does not disappoint. I probably would give it 5 stars, but the organization of the book was confusing at first. It took me a while to catch the rhythm. Otherwise, more great images, expanses, and human civilization questions. Looking forward to the third installment.
第40条评论: This series is excellent...it is especially interesting to read a Chinese author, and how much their political culture is reflected in the books. The authors knowledge of physics and astronomy are......astronomical
第41条评论: [spoilers?]One of the wall facers dreams up an imaginary gf, apparently to the author this is the highest form of intelligence. but do we hear abt anything other than her fragility and beauty? no. is this ever called out as weird? nope. when he tasks his men to find her, they do, and they live happily. like what ???i loved the first book but after finishing this one i didn’t want to start the third. shame.
第42条评论: Definitely check this out. Start out slow, but picks up speed. The second book in the trilogy. A must recommend.
第43条评论: If it is possible to travel at the speed of light.... This seemingly interesting but innocent question has had tremendous impact on human society since Einstein published his relativity papers. Not just for the extremely small world of quantum, but for the solar system the galaxy and the universe. Now it was extended by Liu Cixin to question the very nature of universe. Despite the (im)possibility of light-speed travel, the logic flows flawlessly and the beauty can only be imagined by the most curious minds. How one could imagine to witness the end of the universe or the life beyond? This is the sort of questions Liu Cixin challenges us to ask and he provides some of the answers with outrageous possibilities. Of course there are flaws in the book but it merely put a dent on the entire universe he created. If you like to be challenged and have boundless imaginations and curiosity about the future of humans, this is the book to read and ponder.
第44条评论: Amazing, could not put down, the plots within the plots within the plots…must read, highly recommend.  Cannot wait to read book three.
第45条评论: Big fan of the infinite chain of suspicion. This resulted in an elegant answer for the question re how a society of primitive technology (vav a competing world) could defeat one possessing far greater technology.
第46条评论: So much fluff and very little substance in comparison. Has a few good parts that shows the author is capable of much more. That's the only reason I didn't give it one star despite being an overall was of my time.
第47条评论: Despite a deeply engaging premise and articulate expoloration of the philosophical aspect of first contact and the importance of fundamental physics, Dark Forest routinely trips over its own fundamntal flaw: insufficeint research and unnecessary exposition.The volume of research needed for a book like this is massive given the vastness and quantity of subjects that it explores. It’s quite possible that in its current state it might never have been written if the author had attempted accuracy in all things. Chriton and Wier (The Martian) curtail the scope of their projects to their own expertise and still spent years researching before writing. Liu, instead, ventures unnecessary exposition on subjects that belie the limits of his research and break the fourth wall. We don’t need to know, for instance, that the author thinks space-based telescopes would have lenses or that those lenses would be made by Zeiss (In the book much is made about the size of the Hubble II telescope but larger telescopes, especially space-based telescopes like Hubble and Keppler use mirrors instead of heavy glass due to the mechanical limitations of heavy refractive elements) but a little research could have turned an awkward scene into a fluid one at least. With Wier the inclusion of details like this often seems awkward and disrupts the drama of a scene but they are thoroughly researched and are often necessary for the reader to understand the mind of the protagonist. With Liu details like this are likewise awkward and disrupt the drama of the scene but because they’re often insufficiently researched they also undermine the credibility of the author. And yet, they continue to add up. Telescopes, space planes, AI, bullets- old technologies are dusted off and presented as new, current technologies are presented inaccurately and emerging technologies are ignored or dismissed out of hand.Liu excells at the far out, the multidimensional and the philosophical but stubmbles close to home and it makes for a herky-jerky read that’s not unlike a teenager learning to drive a stick shift.
第48条评论: For about the first third, I thought this book was incredibly boring with an absurd premise and aimless plot. By about the halfway point it became quite interesting, and at turns gripping and terrifying. Like "Three Body Problem", there's an overall strangeness (shall I say, foreignness?) about this book, and I still maintain the whole premise of the Trisolarans and the sophons and the Earth-Trisolaris Society and the Three Body game and all that are pretty goofy. And then add to that the equally goofy Wallfacers and Wallbreakers, and then a completely banal future society. But add into the mix some game theory, some rather grim meditations on the nature of society and the meaning of life, plot lines that come and go and then end abruptly, and writing that is dripping with symbolism, and somehow it all works, even if it doesn't all make sense. Overall I enjoyed it better than "Three Body Problem".
第49条评论: This book is amazing. Picks up where Three Body left off, and introduces us to new characters and and brings back some we already know. Like Three Body, the author builds a deep, sophisticated background. What separates this story is the pace and scope. Once this story gets going, hold on! A much more exciting and suspenseful story than the first book. This time we see things happening from Earth all the way to the edges of the Solar System, with fantastic characters throughout over a course of several hundred years. Fantastic read.
第50条评论: Sophons, those mysterious sub-atomic particles that enable the Trisolarians to surveil all humanity and simultaneously preventing further human scientific development were an interesting literary device, but tested my ability to willingly suspend my disbelief.  Cool idea, though.  And the portrait of the advanced Earth civilization, its underground cities, its very impressive space armadas were fascinating and nicely portrayed.  But the constant reference to "defeatism" as a product of the mind which can be identified and extirpated -- indeed, must be extirpated --  was, I confess, annoying and unnecessary.  My major objection, however, concerns Earth's "strategy" of placating a perceived adolescent jealousy among various space commands for each other by allowing every armada of warships to gather closely around an unknown alien star craft so that no one of them could claim to be first on the scene.  This strategy, of course, put Earth's entire defense against Trisolarian invasion at risk and, for that reason, was beyond belief.  I read the 3 Body Problem with delight.  The Dark Forest, because of this flaw and others, with less delight.
第51条评论: The Three Body Problem was a fresh and unique take on a first contact story, framed within Chinese culture influenced by recent history.The Dark Forest is a fictional extrapolation of Cixin Liu’s Dark Forest answer to Fermi’s paradox. While interesting, the two axiom hypothesis is incredibly simple. While the authors description of future society with a sophon “physics block” is vivid, colorful, and interesting the book seems lengthened unnecessarily and is weighed down with descriptions of humanity’s apathy and despair in the face of an overwhelming hostile alien force bent on annihilation.I’ll still read the third book in the series, but this is definitely not as strong as his first entry in the trilogy.
第52条评论: Fantastic book and series.  As others have said, it is different, but I read a lot of sci fi, and this is not utterly mind blowing stuff, in my opinion.  I think part of what I really love about it is that it is not too technical on the hard science and does not try too hard to blow anyone away with utter weirdness.  Even an Journalism major like myself can understand most of the scientific concepts.  It's somewhat hard to describe why I love this series so much, but I absolutely do.  The characters are not super deep, but they are deep enough for me, and I care about them and find them intriguing.  I can't wait to get back to the final book, and I'll be sad when it ends.
第53条评论: Should be required reading for all SETI & adjacent researchers.Shush! I have always loved the Dark Forest Theory as an explanation for the fermi paradox. Joyfully terrifying.
第54条评论: I loved this novel. Wonderful story, great characters (very atypical people, be prepared for that) and a deep, thoughtful, humanistic perspective on a grand cosmic scale. I was surprised to find such relatable feelings and ideas from a Chinese book; I though cultural barriers would make it remote for a South American reader... nothing like that! Devious plots that remind me of Asimov (what an ending!!!) and a lyrical style make it irresistible for me. Already starting book 3 of the series... Death's End.
第55条评论: This is the second book in a trilogy about how mankind deals with the threat of an approaching enemy alien fleet. The first book in the series must be read before reading this one. I had a tough time keeping up with which character was which, but a lot of that had to do with their names (most of whom were Chinese-sounding.) The first half of the book is slow going, but it picks up after that. One of the major plot points was telegraphed well in advance, and I grew impatient waiting for it to take place so the book could move on. However, there are some other twists that occur that are unexpected. The author is a physicist, and it shows - some pretty amazing stuff is in this book. Overall a rewarding read. I look forward to reading the concluding novel of the series.
第56条评论: Immersive, detailed. Breadth of scope returning to details in a way which manages to avoid leaving tge reader struggking to find their new surroundings.
第57条评论: As has been  said previously, we, the human race, should be careful about disclosing our existence to the larger universe. The information may end up in their wrong hands. Might be invaded by a by a race not as benevolent as the Trisolarians.
第58条评论: I can’t put the book down, I want to know what is going to happen next! The details are so fascinating!
第59条评论: Reading a Chinese Sci-Fi trilogy that has been translated to English is new for me. I have completed the first book and started the second book. This is a fun series because the characters are all new to me not only because they are Chinese but because of how they live and think. So are the twist and turns in this story. As we have all been taught, the Far Eastern mind is quite different from the American mind and that definitely comes through in this series. If you are ready for a good read that will expose you to new characters, new ways of thinking AND new Sci-Fi concepts, you should try these books. If the series ends as well as it has gone so far, I will buy more Cixin Liu books.
第60条评论: This was a fun read with great sci-fi concepts to think about while going through quarantine. There can be a lot explaining moments where it “tells” the plot instead of “shows”. It’s very entertaining regardless.
第61条评论: If you have read Three Body Problem, do not hesitate to continue on to Dark Forest. A rewarding experience in scientific, philosophical, and narrative senses that compels comparisons to Empire Strikes Back as we reach the portion of the story where the brass tacks come out.
第62条评论: This was better than the first book. Fascinating book on the exploration not just of human nature, but the nature of life in the universe as a whole. Ending was a teensy bit cliche, but since it was like 2 pages of the whole book I do not care.
第63条评论: I started reading this after the 1st book in the series.  The beginning is quite slow as individual pieces of the mosaic are laid out one by one without obvious connection to each other.  Then it makes more and more sense.
第64条评论: I won't say much, except that this story was quite difficult to predict and every turn was amazing and kept me thinking.  This is certainly a rare and amazing masterpiece.
第65条评论: Brilliant work by someone who has really thought out the Fermi Paradox. I've read lots of work by a wide variety of science fiction writers, but this series really feels comfortably at the bleeding edge of 21st Century thinking without being cliché. Kudos to Tor Books! Wish there was more sooner rather than later.
第66条评论: Nice dive into mass psychology over time.
第67条评论: Very enjoyable book and excellent translation. Gives one a peak into the Chinese psyche yet shows more clearly our similarities. Hopefully our two governments could come to peaceful accommodations, though not through coercion.  He who knows does not speak. Thus spoke Zarathustra, proving he knew nothing.
第68条评论: Loved the first book in the series and read the rest, truly amazing.  Cixin Liu is so incredibly imaginative and intelligent telling his story both on the micro and macro level of humanity.
第69条评论: This translator is a little flowery compared to "Three-Body Problem," but I like it.  Still a good story.
第70条评论: A wonderful journey of discovery and universe-building that still speaks to the human condition. Wonderfully written: inspiring ideas with elegant execution.
第71条评论: While I loved the first book, this book was unfortunately, did little for me.  The translation was the primary problem, as the dialog felt terribly stilted and lifeless. Liu contributed to my dissatisfaction by telling so much without showing. There was simply too much exposition.I'll be reading the third book, but I'm not excited.
第72条评论: I can't say whether Liu's translation of the first book is any better than Martinsen's tranlsation here, but the fact that Liu's sets the stage for the whole series is pretty important. I noticed several points where Martinsen must have translated something from the original Chinese in a different way than Liu did. For instance, Red Coast base from Three Body Problem is referred to as Red Shore here. Small differences, but it does make you do a double take.Separate from that, I guess I enjoyed this one. It's definitely a slower-moving plot than Three Body, which is kind of ironic because it really does just jump right into it with an enormous cast of characters. The plot and key characters really solidify after about 100 pages, after which it is a much more comfortable read. The scale of this book is extremely huge compared to Three Body, and even though it has a hard sci fi core it verges confidently into the realm of fantasy.
第73条评论: In book two of the trilogy that began with the "three body problem" the alien threat looms ever closer, but humans are confident that their technological blooming has reached a stage where they can confidentially expel the invaders.  When they are proven wrong a humble astronomer, hibernated in the 21st century and recently awakened, may be earth's only hope!Book two opens with what I believe were some translation issues -- the book seemed very slow to start for me, and this may be cultural differences.  The early pages are filled with political and philosophical debate that seemed slow and awkward.  However, once past that, the reader is rewarded with a true scifi philosophers concept of the intergalactic universe, tragedy at a global scale, and finally, Hope.
第74条评论: I loved the Three Body Problem and was looking forward to reading this next volume in the trilogy. I was really happy with the translator's work on the first book, and was disappointed to see it was a different translator. That anticipatory disappointment proved to be all too accurate. The book itseff is an excellnt book, but I found the translation style not as well-suited to the book as I found that of The Three Body Problem.I am looking forward to reading the third book when it is available, with translation by the same person who did the first book. Not that I understand  Chinese and thus am familiar with the works in their original language, but there was something authentic in the first book's style of translation that wasn't in this translation.
第75条评论: This series continues to draw me along. Several times i have thought i saw where it was going and had few been wrong. A staggering work by a new author to me.
第76条评论: This novel did not live up to my expectations, but it is worth reading.  I was a little peeved the plot in this book depends on information revealed in this book, rather than information/characters/plot from the first book.  This is a minor complaint but as a result I felt like I was reading something conceived entirely outside the scope of the original novel - kind of like seeing a movie sequel that was made many years later by a different writer, director and producer.Ironically, I wanted more character/story development in the first novel, but in this book I could have used a little less!  There were entire passages I skimmed through.  (The old guys in China? What was the purpose of those sections?)  And it turns out major plot events and details early on were even less relevant to the ending than I had anticipated.  (Luo Ji's plan is clever but doesn't ultimately achieve any outcome different to the other strategies proposed!)  Having said that... there were a few moments in the book that took my breath away as I was reading - they were totally unexpected and worth the effort to reach them.  And let's be honest - I can't wait to start the third book tonight!
第77条评论: Volume two in the Trilogy of the “Three Body Problem” again dazzles with its array of science and fiction.  The translation highlights the Chinese character of the players and is more fluid than in volume one.  Dr. Luo Ji, the last of the Wallfacers comes out of 200 years of hibernation and is challenged to seek a solution to an impeding Doomsday destruction by the Trisolarians.  Earth’s defensive fleet is all but demolished.  The excitement and desperation builds, as Luo Ji appears to take his own sweet time to resolve the crisis much to the consternation of those around him.  In the end his strategy works, not withstanding the superior intelligence and firepower of the Aliens and he is able to deter the final conflagration.  This is a challenging read but massive in its scientific outreach and imagination.
第78条评论: Part science, part mystery, part search for meaning. You should assume nothing but expect to be fully unmasked and it will satisfy.
第79条评论: The plot is weird and highly improbable.The science is shaky at best, full of handwaves and absurdities. Far too much technobabble without much substance.The knife edge is traversed carefully between angering the PRC while still producing a story that isn't wholly choked by a totalitarian Big Brother.The characters are generally unlikable and two dimensional. Luo Ji doesn't make any sense and Shi Qiang couldn't possibly exist in the real world. There's vey little love felt towards any character.The ultimate goal of the past two books so far has culminated in a shoulder shrug of a finale. Not compelling or eye opening.The only real surprise was Luo Ji's spell, which I feel was the only truly believable part of the whole story. Luo's wife and child felt more like set dressing or MacGuffins than actual people.A book I can easily recommend you save to read after you have cleared the world's library, first.
第80条评论: Cixin Liu does a brilliant job of introducing concepts and key concepts early on and then obscuring them in mystery even from the characters until the plot demands it. As a work this series is incredibly ambitious. Steeped not only in scientific theory but also philosophy and sociology. Some parts could use a little more levity to balance out the door but otherwise great pacing imaginative world building on a conceptual level. Great follow up to 3 body all in all really making this feel like an expansive saga rather than a continuous book split into 3 parts.
第81条评论: This series of books is basically the craziest, most fantastic thing ever. The authors creativity and storytelling skills are amazing. I highly recommend these books to everybody, regardless of whether you enjoy sci-fi or not.
第82条评论: The transaction was great, I simply disliked the book vehemently. No female characters of any importance, the fun sci-fi stuff went out the window. I struggled to finish it but ultimately quit about 50 pages before the end. It wasn’t worth one page, per moi. I realize mine may be a minority opinion but there ya go.
第83条评论: This will be a spoiler free review. I wish I had been able to find one as I was deciding whether or not to finish this book. Hopefully this review will help others in the same situation.I rated the first book in this series 5 stars. It was thought-provoking and even though the character development was lacking, the pacing and plot kept me reading and I finished it in about 2 days. There were multiple mind blowing reveals and I was left thinking about the premise for quite some time.This book is noting like that. First, the writing is amateurish and boring. It reads like fanfic. Bad fanfic.And unfortunately, there is no payoff. There are really only a couple big reveals, and they're not written in a way that is satisfying. You could just as easily read a summary and not waste your time.Having wasted several hours finishing just to finish, I wish I had just read a summary and been done. I will not be reading the third installment and further wasting my time.
第84条评论: I really enjoyed this book as it explores what could happen when humans finally make contact with an extra terrestrial civilization.  There are a lot of surprises in this book - the 2nd of a trilogy.  Unfortunately, the extraterrestrials are hostile - and the book does a great job of exploring how human psychology responds to what is at that point the greatest threat that human civilization has ever encountered.
第85条评论: I loved this series. I had no idea how he was going to end this and it kept me guessing right up until the end. This is brilliant and worth the time and effort to read it. I'm definitely going to read it again
第86条评论: For those who have an appreciation of conceptual science fiction, layered into rich story-telling - this book is an epic masterpiece, even better than the first!
第87条评论: Holy ****. While I struggled to get into the first book, this one makes the first worth reading. I’m so excited to read the next installation.
第88条评论: I really enjoyed the depth of the story, and it's creativeness as well. I can't wait to read the third and final book of this trilogy!
第89条评论: Cixin Liu is like a Chinese Greg Bear who can write interesting characters. I found reading books in my favorite genre, written from a very different cultural perspective, refreshing.I'll tell you my least favorite thing about this book: I have to wait until next August to read the last one.
第90条评论: I like some Chinese movies (example Not One Less) but the pattern or style of Chinese communication takes getting used to.  Perhaps it is the translation that imparts the weird flavor.  I notice this in dubbed French and Spanish films.  I don't notice this in translations of German works.  Just my thoughts.
第91条评论: If you liked “The Three Body Problem”, the follow-up novel is truly extraordinary. I do not want to say more in the review lest it spoil the book, but the scale of the story is quite expansive and the final revelation (as it were) is quite intriguing. This may be one of the finest science fiction novels ever written, superior to both its prequel and its sequel.
第92条评论: Starts sloooow.  Actually put it down for a month or two after first 25% but picked it up again since I had spent money on it, and I'm glad I did. The book finishes very strong with a lot of surprises, thought provoking concepts, and good sci-fi action. Second book I've read by this author and I'd be likely to read another.
第93条评论: This series has to be considered among the great works of science fiction. The writing is not poetic, (and that may well be on account of the inherent difficulties in translation between two very different languages) but the characters are complex and satisfying. So is the plot. Looking forward to reading the third volume.
第94条评论: Surprisingly well written given that it's a translation. This series is not the cartoon future envisioned in Star Wars, nor the feel good kumbaya vision of Star Trek. It's closer in tone to the dark view of the future of Battlestar Galactica. The author does a great job of capturing the uncertainty of that future and takes the reader on an entertaining rollercoaster ride of dashed expectations, hope and despair. Well worth the time to read it, and I'm looking forward to the next.
第95条评论: Cixin Liu May be the greatest SF writer around. This trilogy is incredibly complex, creative and well written.
第96条评论: As good as, possibly better, than the first book in the series.  I didn't notice any deterioration in the quality of the translation either.  I have already pre-ordered the last of the trilogy.  I hope this trilogy leads readers to his short stories in his short fiction collectedions and available through Kindle for individual stories,.  As a  budding student of Chinese politics and environmental and sustainability policies, I hope to write a lengthy review of the trilogy when I have read and pondered its significance.
第97条评论: Thought-provoking. Interesting astro-physics concepts, but don't let that scare you. Reading this inspired me to consider some other scientific possibilities. The Chinese perspective adds a dimension rarely seen in most American science fiction writing. It's the second book in the trilogy, which I read first and later read the first and third books. This can be read out of order and is still great, perhaps even better than the first and third of the trilogy.
第98条评论: i havebeen readingsci fi since the early 60s. nothingquite like this. well thought out.  definitely worth your time. enjoy
第99条评论: This second part of the Three Body Problem trilogy packs almost every science fiction trope into a fast read that grips with curiosity from the opening scene to a nail biting conclusion. Liu Cixin has a way of creating vast images that also have fascinating detail. What a marvelous and developed imagination. The Three Body Problem stood complete and satisfying. Now the Dark Forrest greatly expands the story in time. Can't wait to read the final book.
第100条评论: This was a big disappointment to me after the first book, the Three Body Problem, which I loved. I don't know if it's because of a change in translators or a general drop in quality, but this book left me disappointed. There are no fully realized female characters (although there were in the first book, they're gone now), in fact one of the only female characters is so blatantly a "wish-fulfillment" device that I couldn't help but swung wildly between disgust and a slim expectation that she was being set up to be something bigger and greater in the end. No such luck, just an offensively badly written character with zero agency existing only to satisfy some pathetic fantasy for a male author.As for the rest of the book...the plot relies on large leaps of logic and faith to set up the action, and doesn't really set up much motivation for the characters with agency (all male). This was a big disappointment to me after loving the Three Body Problem so much.
第101条评论: If you liked the first you'll enjoy this one as well. Not to complex or fast paced, but thoughtful and thought provoking.
第102条评论: Great read. More disjointed than the first book. Understandably so. Way more far reaching. Sometimes hard to follow. Can't wait for September for the release of the third in the series. Already purchased by advanced copy on Kindle.
第103条评论: Easily the most imaginative SF novel I read in a long time and a very worthy successor to The Three Body Problem. Anyone with an interest in hard SF must read this.
第104条评论: Clearly used and overpriced for what it is.
第105条评论: This is a great series of books,especially with the historical and cultural aspects
第106条评论: Good premise. Some of the language is awkward.
第107条评论: 2nd in Cixin's trilogy.  Just as mind-blowing as the first.  I may never view the heavens in the same way.
第108条评论: Amazing science and thrilling storytelling.
第109条评论: The book is very imaginative but at times extremely slow and painful to read. The end was anti-climatic, but the authors imagination through the book makes this book an enjoyable read.
第110条评论: I am totally addicted to this series. So happy to have found it and cannot wait until April 2016 for the 3rd book!!  I have read 100's of sci fi books and this is definitely up there in my top 20.
第111条评论: Amazing story full of wonderful ideas. Addictive!Couldn’t put it down.Beautifully written and translated.Can’t wait for Death’s End!
第112条评论: I often had to put this book down for a bit and contemplate what I have just read and to stop my mind from boggling. Sort of calm down the heart beat and remember to start breathing again.The insight and foresight of the writer is a pleasure one does not often encounter in literature.A great story teller and a great mind.
第113条评论: Cixin Liu strikes again with another incredible sci fi epic. Few writers since Asimov have been able to handle massive time and space jumps as deftly as Liu does here while still making human emotion and characters the center of the story. Immediately picking up the next in the series and can't wait to see how the trilogy concludes!
第114条评论: I overlooked and forgave its sometimes weak literary plot moments and awkward dialogue moments and was willing to chalk them up to translation issues, and to an overly ambitious author who seeks to address so many aspects of life and civilization that all cannot be perfectly addressed.  I overlooked and forgave because the book constantly led me to logical dead ends and gave me opportunities to think and reason past them.
第115条评论: Ok, so I am glad I came back to this series. I really do think brilliant is the best word to describe it.  I am sure I have read stores with better writing, pacing, and overall storyline.  If fact, there were still times in which I got a little lost in this story, much like the first book.  But overall, I am not sure I have read a sci-fi or fiction book that is just as smart as this.  The plot twists, the behavior of all parties involved in the story, and the problems that arise are all just so smart.  I routinely found myself pausing and actually thinking “man, that is smart”.  Really unique and brilliant series.  Cant wait to see how it ends.
第116条评论: This book has a lot going for it. It is chock *full* of ideas which is so crucial to great SciFi. Liu also does a great job of giving you a sense of what it would be like to live in a world where all of humanity is threatened by giving you little vignettes of life among ordinary citizens. Halfway through the book he pulls a very gutsy narrative move that could have failed spectacularly (I'm looking at you Seveneves) but pulls it off. All this he does with a uniquely Chinese aesthetic and human feeling that shows on every page.So why four and not five stars?It drags in parts. Now that the mystery of what's going on has been revealed (in The Three Body Problem) some of the rocket fuel that sped the series along has been used up. As we watch humanity struggle with their situation and face road block after roadblock there are places I wished Liu would just give a small summary chunk of exposition and zoom us forward to the next exciting development in the Trisolaran standoff.However, when we *do* get to the developments they are worth it, climaxing in a wonderful solution to the Fermi Paradox that will punch you in the face.Are you looking for something new in the sleepy landscape of modern SF? Read this series.
第117条评论: OK, OK. So I have to start this out by saying that at the outset, I wasn't quite feeling the same intense level of infatuation that I did with the first book, Three Body Problem. The narrative seemed fickle, flitting from one thing to another, and some of the speculative stuff admittedly flew way over my head. I didn't quite have the same connection with the characters as I did in the first book, even those who were actually IN the first book.But, man. This story is a slow burn. The events plod ever forward, sometimes in ways that don't make much sense, but it's all part of the journey, and the endpoint, when it comes, is IMMENSELY satisfying as a result.Stick with this one. The first part was slow going for me, and the last hundred pages were the best, culminating in the ending. It's an amazing journey and when everything finally comes together, it's like an emotional sucker-punch, but in a good way.Liu Cixin's writing transcends science fiction. It's highly inspirational and absolutely rewarding to read and experience. I can't WAIT to see what the third book in the trilogy brings.We leave the future Earth of this story in a very certain tone and frame of mind...I wonder if it will last. Whatever comes next, it's going to be amazing.Bravo, Mr. Liu. Bravo.
第118条评论: I really liked the first book of the trilogy, but it had a few small shortcomings (but I still think it's awesome). This book is almost perfect, the ideas are - if not realistic - still mind-blowing and the writing and pacing of the book is very good.I hated one small part, where a guy (no spoiler here, don't be afraid) in space shoots 30 times in ten seconds and tries to hit a few targets 5.000 meters away. This is just idiotic, even a trained sniper couldn't shoot across that distance multiple times in 30 seconds, and the guy I talk about is using a pistol and is hanging in space in a space suit.I was a little bit angry at the editors. Plainly the author knows nothing about shooting and didn't do his research. That's ok, because his strength lies in many other fields. But his editors and other proof readers should have stumbled about this. Because the bad thug is if you read something stupid like this in a book that's apart from this quite smart you start to question the other things you encounter. And the book doesn't deserve this.Sooo... I'm only really happy with 99.9% of this volume, and that's quite a number. The author has my deepest respect, and the translator, too!
第119条评论: Cixim Liu's trilogy is perhaps the most alien set of books on Tor's front list. The writing, the narrative structure, the character development, the episodic plot . . . are not like US/UK science fiction . . . but they are absolutely worth reading and are perhaps the most interesting Chinese novels I've read in years. The translation of all three books is uneven, making it hard to tell how careful a writer Cixim Liu might be. The books read, at times, like sloppy Vernor Venge . . . adequately written but somewhat unedited, perhaps. If you can set aside the wobbly translation, however, you'll find a wonderful set of tales nested inside other tales nested inside histories, real and imaginary, that are as lively and insightful and strange and wonderful as the best US/UK science fiction. Are the three books an allegory of China's relationship to the West? Maybe. That's at least part of what's going on. Are the books about China's relationship to it's own history? Maybe. Are they some of the most insightful, scientific, thoughtful first-contact stories? Yes. Are they a Chinese response to, oh, the X-files and Greg Bear and post-50s US science fiction in general? Yes. Are they readable, exciting, smart, weird, upsetting, comforting, nostalgic, silly, angry, patriotic, pro/anti-Western, politically complex, and looser than than an Alan Moore comic? Yeah, they are. Have fun!
第120条评论: I am giving it a 5 because it sets precedence to the plot for the next book. And my god, the next book is amazing! just barely halfway and I can understand how much the plot in Book 3 relates in every way to Book 2.Book 2 can be agonizingly slow, with too many complex characters to follow.. But the real fun begins when the complex plots from different persons were interweave together at the 4th quarter of the book; when it all made sense. But it ONLY made sense if the story had written in the flow that the reader had followed. I admit, I have been dishonest from reading sequentially these chapters because the characters were being flung around several chapters apart. Luckily they are easily traced by their chapter heading title.It was agonizingly slow at some point that I had to keep my interest going by skipping some chapters then going back to read the chapters I skipped.Still, it is the best Sci-Fi I have read! The science is made almost believable. When you reach the end of the book, you will understand why. When I had reached there...it is only when I reach the epilogue, I truly understand the vastness of time.
第121条评论: This trilogy is the first Chinese fiction I’ve read and it’s FANTASTIC! Liu is a master. If you’re interested in invasion plot sci-fi or Chinese lit please do yourself a favor and check this out.
第122条评论: So much to dislike in this book it’s hard to know where to begin.Sci-fi has been my favorite genre for decades so I was excited to start this highly rated book.  What a vast disappointment- and a complete waste of money.It’s BORING!  There’s so much “filler” where absolutely nothing happens that I just skimmed about 1/3 of the book.Dozens of characters and zero character development. Zero.Horrible dialogue.  Occasional casual interactions that are halfway plausible interspersed with such stilted exchanges it sounds like robots talking.Military-esque techno jargon that seems more for the author’s enjoyment than the readers’.Absurd plot points - an enemy ship is seen racing ahead of the larger invasion fleet.  So, the military geniuses decide its objective is to negotiate a truce with Earth.  What??The Wallfacers don’t make any sense at all.  Was this supposed to be an example of the author’s creativity?  Honestly, it’s just plain stupid. There’s the possibility that a better writer could have made something compelling with the Wallfacer concept but Lui has botched it spectacularly.The “mental seal” that makes people believe victory is inevitable (and was secretly given to everyone on Earth) is a marginally innovative idea that could have been explored further but it’s only dealt with superficially.The (very) few women in the book are either some acquiescent fantasy ideal or just weak.I don’t care what happens to anyone in the book.
第123条评论: The Dark Forest is the second volume of a huge trilogy by Cixin Liu. I am reading this because I am very interested in contemporary Chinese culture, not simply for entertainment. So I was determined to stick with it through all of the difficult aspects. The trilogy does deliver a great reading experience if you are willing to go where it takes you. Some aspects of it are confusing, and it takes a while to get used to the names so that you can follow the story. I enjoyed the second section more than the first section: the story is compelling and very strange, so it gives you the sense that things are getting better as you go along through the trilogy. I am looking forward to the next volumes. and I have no idea where it is going to go, so that is a very attractive aspect of Cixin Liu's writing.
第124条评论: You may not want to finish with regard to how this book starts…but I say push thru…the pay off is outstanding, unexpected and beautiful - both the good and the bad.
第125条评论: This is one of the finest SF series I have read. I believe it compares to Foundation by Asimov. The third book won't be translated and published until August, and it is painful to have to wait.It is a great example of the Chinese long view of history. The author has spread the main events out over centuries, but the western reader does not get lost. The characters are vividly presented. Like other epic stories, some of the characters you love may die.The author's knowledge of a broad range of scientific subjects is clear.  It probably helps to at least have a nodding acquaintance with physics. Even the titles of the books require some knowledge to  fully appreciate, each being a famous unsolvable problem.  If you don't recognize them or don't have an astrophysicist friend, Google them or go to Wikipedia.
第126条评论: My personal favorite in the trilogy series. I read both the Chinese version and the English version. The translated one preserve most of the original writing. The only major change compared to the original one is the plan of Tyler-- one of the wallfacers. In the Chinese version, Tyler plans to use so-called "Quantum Ghost Worriers" to beat the alien fleet, which, in my opinion, is definitely a flaw in this fantastic work. The plan Tyler has in the English version, which I am not going to spoil the fun of your reading here, is much cleverer and more reasonable.On the other hand, I do not fully agree with the "Dark Forest" scheme of the universe Liu proposed in this book. I do not think the technology explosion is necessarily true. But this tiny doubt will not affect the joy of the reading at all.Overall, five stars recommendation!
第127条评论: After the first book, the time jump was challenging. It took me a little to get going but after that I couldn’t put the book down.
第128条评论: The concepts introduced in this book series are incredibly thought provoking. It's such an immersive, well-crafted world that parallels our own so closely. It truly feels like a history book sent back in time. Being based in our reality at times makes it feel too real, and it's so thought-intensive that I was emotionally exhausted when I finished the trilogy. It even ended up inspiring me to write again. This is the best book series I have read this decade, even though it does fall short on character development. Even with this flaw, I felt no loss of worth whatsoever. The characters are mostly human and relatable, and while sometimes one-dimensional, they are rarely predictable. It's impossible to overstate my love for this world Cixin Liu created, and I can't emphasise enough how awesome the stories it contains are.
第129条评论: This is the second book in the series started by The Three Body Problem.  I couldn't recommend this series more.  In the genre of hard science fiction, this is the best series I've read in many years (maybe ever).Three Body Problem was amazing but this book is actually even better and, believe it or not, the final book in the trilogy (Death's End) is the best of the bunch.  You owe it to yourself to get into this series if you are a fan of the genre or just a person who is interested in science, technology or the various possibilities stretched out in front of humanity when looking forward into the future.  Stop reading this review and buy the book!
第130条评论: I can't talk about this book series enough. Three Body Problem and The Dark Forest are masterpieces of science fiction. Liu Cixin deftly blends science and technology, philosophy, and creativity. The stories he writes are so intelligent and grounded in culture and history that they feel real. This is one of the best translated works I've read in years. The English-speaking world waited far too long to start translating Chinese science fiction. I hope Liu Cixin is only the first in a great wave of border crossing Chinese sci fi. Absolutely wonderful book. You will devour it in a matter of days, if not hours. The movie based off Three Body Problem comes out this year, and I for one will be waiting for the second a subbed version is released.
第131条评论: Just buy this book! And buy The Three Body Problem as well. Go ahead and by Death's End as well. Because waiting a day for a book in the series to show up is pure torture.
第132条评论: Loved the series, but the ending in book 3 was a tad disappointing. Overall, great concept.
第133条评论: Makes you think - is it really a great idea to broadcast our location to the cosmos!
第134条评论: Like the first book, this one starts a little slow, but has a number of twists and turns that makes sense once you look back. Very enjoyable read.
第135条评论: First 400 pages of this book were torture for me. But I'm really curious what is going to happen in this trilogy. End of the book pick up speed. Still interested in how the trilogy is going to resolve.
第136条评论: What a cool story.  Philosophy science interstellar-politics and adventure all on one, my favorite sci fi series since enders game.
第137条评论: Science is the body of sci-fi, but humanity is its heart. Cixin knows this, and it is what makes this and all his other works great.
第138条评论: This book is absolutely incredible, and in my opinion the best of the trilogy. I didn't care for the third one, but my God, this one in particular... Liu has some fantastic and mind blowing ideas.
第139条评论: Pretty good and I liked the ending quite a bit. Recommended.
第140条评论: This is my favorite book of the trilogy.  Book one was the set, and this is the spike.
第141条评论: This is an awesome read. There is a lot going on so be ready. Worth the read for sure.
第142条评论: This reached 5 stars on the last pageIt could hace been softer with the protagonists, to avoid the temporal hatread against the whole novel during most of the last chapterAnd the destiny of Zhang Beihai could have been unknown Better even if life extenssion technology gets developedIt is better to leave fantasies alive You never know if some future AI can extend your novels in a fantastic way
第143条评论: Oh boy, what a page turner!First, allow me to address two points that those who criticize the books usually make:1- That the books are too far off, not based on science. Well, you know what? Maybe they are correct. Maybe “science-fiction” is not how we should characterize these books. Perhaps they are better characterized as “fantastic-fiction”. But I have something to say to those people: Science-Fiction can only be loosely based on present state science… The rest is FICTION!! I suggest readers consider the fact that we know very little about the nature of the universe.  We don’t even fully understand what time or gravity are! So, leave your knowledge of physics at the door for a moment, and enjoy a great story!2- Lack of character development… Honestly, I do not understand where this criticism comes from. Characters are rich, well developed, across their lifetimes, and even beyond their graves, carrying over from one book to another! What more can you ask for?Anyways, I’ve read plenty of Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clark, Asimov, Frank Herbert (and his son), and I must say, this author is absolutely unique. He’s an amazing storyteller and I am absolutely in love with his work. I feel like the first time I read Asimov. As if I had just discovered a new world.Take a chance! You won’t regret it.Be forewarned though: The author tends to take his long sweet time setting up the story to its climax. Both in the first book and in the second one in the series (this book), it’s only about 70% into the book that things start making sense and tying together. If you do not have enough “reader stamina” to stay with it and give up halfway through the book you will be missing on a masterpiece!! Best, Raphael.
第144条评论: I really enjoyed all three of the books in The Three-body series but The Dark forest is my favorite. A must read for anyone who likes sci fi or just a good story.  I can’t recommend it enough.
第145条评论: I’ve probably read more than a 1,000 books.  For some, that’s likely a tiny amount.  I mention the number of books read to establish enough of a sample size to make some observations on where this book sits in the pile of books…I’ve read.This book is in the same cellular structure of Dostoevsky’s “The Idiot”.  For some, the aforementioned will be something that is immediately rejected.  Luo is Prince Myshkin.  The major diversion in/of the tales is one ends how the author sees the world; sadly and with little remorse.  The other, happily and with little remorse.  Both show the macro view of humanity in a way that forces us to see what happens around us daily.  I’m fortunate to have read this book, I’ve read tons of books that have likely made me dumber but entertained me.  This book is important; it deserves to be read.
第146条评论: I really enjoyed the first 80% of the book (my guess as to extent of the story) when there were the four Wallfacers and then the four Wallbreakers to joust with them with evidence and logic. It was crazy but it was very different, and very stimulating. I loved the idea of the four Wallfacers having to keep everything secret, not even talking to other people or having anything in writing or typed or encoded in any way. Because apparently the technology by the enemy space race can pick up anything that is communicated. Wow! How does one reason his way out of that box?I thought this book actually flowed much better than the first one, except for the last 20%, where the story just halts... and just goes way off tangent.I hated the last part of the book. There's a major pre-emptive strike, and I don't want to go into details, to give away spoilers, but boy, that was so mean, so cruel. I know it's war... but, geez!I thought of some huge plot holes for the book, and unless I missed something, here they are:- How would the mind seal apply to future generations? I thought once the bearers of the mind seal died, the physical imprint (or rather mental imprint) would die with them. Also, I'm not sure the mind seal played any role in the last part of the book, so why bring it up again?- It's said that the aliens' technology halted technological progress of the humans. The story really waffled on this one. At time, humans were frustrated by barriers to further advance, and at other times, they'd accomplished an incredible leap in innovation. In my opinion this subplot should have been deleted completely. It would have made no difference in the plot. Technology is always elusive even without outside interference.- I'm still skeptical humans can still be put into hibernation and then released hundreds of years later without adverse effects. Sorry, not buying it. Also, if it's that good, why would anyone die anymore? Maybe live ten years at a time, enjoy the era, then ask to be awakened fifty years later. Repeat. Then you could enjoy one thousand years by living ten years at a time.- The "droplet"'s power was just too unbelievable to be taken seriously. Why didn't the enemy just release 1,000 of them all at the same time, since obviously they can all get to Earth in half the time of the soldiers? Why bother with a massive fleet if the droplets can take care of everything? It's like a grenade that eliminates half of an enemy army in World War II.- The ending was just too easy. Really? Just like that? Would the universe's enemies actually fire on a faraway, harmless sun for no reason? I don't think, if the space races were that advanced to be able to fire on anything that far away and with such power, would be so dumb. That too-effective and too-all-ending plot device made every other struggle by the humans seem so wasted and so meaningless.
第147条评论: I was blown away by the inventiveness of The Three-Body Problem, the first book in this trilogy.  I wasn’t sure what to expect from this, the second book.  Would it be an excellent continuation or a let down from admittedly high expectations?  Well, I’m pleased to report that I enjoyed this book immensely, and in some ways, more than the original.Mr. Liu’s inventiveness continues in The Dark Forest.  I am completely taken with the Wallfacer/Wallbreaker concept that drives much of the novel.  I enjoy his vision of an earth 200 years in the future, waiting for first physical encounter with an alien culture—a probe in advance of the invasion fleet still 200 years away.  I absolutely love how this contact runs completely against expectations, confirming that, by definition, we cannot have expectations of a culture that is truly alien, especially one that is more advanced than ours.  The emotional bait-and-switch he performs before and after the encounter is excellent.  Finally, the conclusions of this story are at once both logical and surprising.  This novel is a tour de force of science fiction.Of course, because it is a powerful science fiction novel, it has some of the weaknesses that seem to be inherent in even the best science fiction.  Primarily, since this book is driven by a clever plot, character seems to suffer.  Other than Wallfacer Luo Ji and his protector Da Shi and, perhaps, soldier Zhang Beihai, none of the other characters seem to have any real depth.  And, frankly, Mr. Liu’s depiction of the universe as a “dark forest” is quite depressing, though that is not to say he is wrong.  Still, he offers us only faint glimmers of hope.In the end, this is a story that, like the best novels, invites rumination about the nature of the human race and what is out there.  If my view is not as dark as Mr. Liu’s, he challenges me to wonder why I believe what I do.  I am also left wondering what he has left in store for us in the final novel of the trilogy.  I look forward to getting in to that one soon.
第148条评论: 3body is okay but somewhat flawed.  The Dark Forest is so bad that I'm struggling to get through it.  I want to know what happens, so I have to finish, but honestly, he's a terrible writer.  For example:• Hibernation is suddenly introduced.  And by introduced, I mean he starts using the word as if it's a thing the reader is already familiar within the "world".  Not only are we not, it's a jarring misaligning to the state of technology in the rest of the world.• This introduction happens again with Wallfacers.  They just suddenly arrive.  And not only that, the world seems to suddenly just know who they are and what they are.• There are often intricate details that are proffered that make absolutely no sense and are never explained.  He went out of this way to describe how the dish atop the hill made people sick.  We never got to why and it was never mentioned again.  The aircraft that took Ji to his unveiling as a wallfacer required them to be strapped in as it may need to make unusual manoeuvres.  This was never explained.  Later the aircraft did do some abrupt manoeuvring.  Again never explain.  It was just a straightforward commute to the UN building.  WTF.• There are significant scientific inconsistencies.  Dark Forest considers that nuclear weapons would be useless in space.  In 3body the Trisolorians use them against the oops-wrong-number-of-dimensions sophons.  The math on the number of particle accelerators a sophon pair could disrupt is just absurd.  You can transit from on side of the earth to the other ~22 times in one second at the speed of light.  Consider that the particles in a beamline are also moving at close to the speed of light and the numbers are many implausible by many orders of magnitude.  That's before you consider interactions with other particles preventing you from travelling through the earth in a straight line.  Really only neutrinos are going to do this, but they by very definition aren't going to have any impact in a particle beam line.  I could suspend my disbelief if the rest wasn't so badly written.• Even last night when I was reading, somebody basically has what sounds like a panic attack.  They freeze - there is a lot of detail about what their hand is resting on at the time, so my attention is drawn to that as a detail of significance.  But then they suddenly demand sunglasses.  When asked what is wrong, they proclaim "it might be the sun".  When asked "when did you start having this sort of reaction" they answered "just now".  The author goes on "the peculiar phobia for the sun that afflicted Rey Diaz pushed him to the edge..."; That's a huge concept.  Introduced in like 3 sentences with no other explanation.  And it's entirely implausible.  He's never had a reaction before.  He has some form of "medical event" and his first thought is "it might be the sun, bring me sunglasses".  Literally one sentence later, it's a recognised phobia?There are bits here and there that could possibly be written of as artefacts of translation, but generally the author needs some lessons on writing, and an editor.
第149条评论: In is advertised as Hard science fiction - which basically means it is all based on real science - at least from a theoretical standpoint.  That is ridiculous. Just one example:  The concept of instantaneous communications over the span of light years via quantum entanglement. That has been proven false a long time ago and just recently as well. While we do not understand quantum mechanics - and anyone who says we do is a delusional - we do know that faster than light communication in either classical or quantum spaces can't happen.  The most recent experiment was ironically conducted by the Chinese who set up a quantum entangled state between Vienna, Austria and Beijing (this was for the purpose of testing hack proof satellite communications - another subject) and found that communication speed was limited by the speed of light despite the entangled state. As for how a quantum entangled pair can relate to the other in seeming coordination that is still a mystery and beyond modern physics to explain. So is not hard science to say instantaneous voice communication can happen between a point 4 light years away and here.  Of course, does science fiction have to be realistic based on actual proven science? Of course not - but if you call it 'hard science fiction' that is exactly what you are saying.  Bottom line, this is a very good and highly imaginative  trilogy  (not great IMO, perhaps better in original Chinese). But it's just fiction with no plausibility based on known science reality.  The author mixes real science with fantastical science... and he is more focused on making present day social commentaries for the world, but especially in relation to his own countries recent history.
第150条评论: Mind blown. Sometimes the science was hard but overall, what a incredible ongoing story.. A must read for all Futuristic, Space, Science, Alien, Soldier loving nerds!!!!
第151条评论: very interesting look into possible encounter with other civilization.parts of the book are very slow and long, but overall i liked it.
第152条评论: Outstanding narrative with complex interactions between social behaviors, fears, science and the long game —- all from the context and background of a non-western writer.  We always have much to learn from different cultural viewpoints.
第153条评论: As an avid reader of sci-fi, it was refreshing to read the Remembrance of Earth's Past series. It's inventive, well-written series so and Liu is a master at keeping enough information from you to keep you guessing what everyone is thinking. If you like realistic explanations of alien technology then this is your book. It's not like you reading an astrophysics textbook but it's not Star Wars soft either. Liu aims right for the sweet spot for believable sci-fi.I'll admit, I was a little skeptical about the sequel because I didn't know if it would be able to top the fantastic Three Body Problem. Dark Forest dragged a bit in the beginning and I feared that he wouldn't be able to top the first novel. But the story keeps building and building until the second half of the book where all the ideas really come together. You can feel the pressure humanity is under to survive or enjoy their days as the timer counts down to the doomsday battle. And it's so fun and exciting to see a character's plan to come through as they create their own fate only to be put in a tougher dilemma.Liu moves into the future with this book. Unlike the previous book, Liu takes the story into the future. Three Body spent quite a bit of time in revolutionary China and was one of the fascinating aspects of the story. I like that I got a little cultural lesson as I read. There is less of that in the sequel.We have a hero but he isn't our focus. We are given an assortment of characters to root for or against. They aren't the most developed characters I've read but I didn't find myself caring too much about that the world itself is the main character here. I even found myself empathizing with the Trisolarans, they have their rational reasons for wanting to exterminate humanity. Who's to say we wouldn't do the same if we were in their position?. I'm not leaving any spoilers here.There are no boogeymen in this universe unless you're talking about the other hunters in the dark forest. You're going to have to read the book figure this one out.It's great, read it.Five Stars!
第154条评论: Okay, I thought the first book, The Three Body Problem, was a bit better.  But this one is a great, the (2nd) sequel.  This and the first book are a little difficult for Westerners, I think, given the emphasis on Chinese characters and Chinese names.  But, his books are a cultural eye-opener.  This one, Dark Forest, sets you up in a not so distant future, with an imminent alien invasion.  What an imagination Liu Cixin has!  Where does he come up with these ideas?, some of which are quite intellectual.  Wow, at times I was blown away.  Now, one of the plot items I thought was a little bit of a set-up (I thought "Come on, they would never do that!") and another I thought was a bit unrealistic (I won't say what these are), but everything else was believable, creative, and inventive.  Liu Cixin is very good at imagery and very good at character building.  You know a novel is good when you don't want to lose or leave the characters.  He did that for me.  So, if you like good (hard) sci fi, read The Three Body Problem and Dark Forest.  Both are thrillers!
第155条评论: Crammed so full of physical, philosophical, metaphysical theory, it'll make your head spin...Add some seriously great sci-fi, and tell it through a cultural lense of someone who's clearly grown up in China, and you'll have book two of this masterful novel series.Sifu Liu's writing style *might* take some getting used to, especially if you've never been exposed to Chinese literary and authoring techniques. But stick with it, and you'll end up reading (and then pondering) some of the best mind-bending sci-fi concepts you've ever encountered.Super. Good. Stuff.
第156条评论: I've read a few books in the Hard Sci Fi genre, and most of them suffer the same issue of putting science over story. Even in cases where the story itself is good, so much emphasis is put on describing the science in grueling detail that the story suffers.That isn't the case in the Dark Forest. Cixin strikes an amazing balance in describing a world with unrealized technology in an approachable way while also keeping the reader entranced in the story. I was so wrapped up in the story that I also bought the audiobook so that I could listen when I couldn't sit and read.Highly suggest this book, it is an amazing follow up to the Three Body Problem, and more than delivers on the setup of the last book.
第157条评论: It's impossible to rate this book on it's own since it's part of a stunning trilogy, and the quality of this book only really shines in the context of the whole. Cixin gets very technical in parts, and descriptions of physics can go on, and on. For that reason, I am glad that I had an audiobook for this one. I'm an academic, and already do a lot of reading, and some sections would start to feel more like work than relaxation. Still, I might have drifted off a little here and there during the most intense technical descriptions, but still paid enough attention to learn a bit about the speed of light, black holes and different dimensions.I also put the series down in the middle of the second book when I realized that there was not a single female character left that was a significant part of the narrative. But, I came back to it eventually, and I'm so glad I did. As it turns out, the 3rd book is largely from a feminine point of view, and thinking back, I'm pretty sure that Cixin was intentionally emphasizing a masculine point of view in the second book.Otherwise, the incredible scope of this book and the sheer audacity of even trying to tell this the story Cixin tells is breathtaking. It even has the quality of a fairy tale, but not a modern Disney version, more like the old dark folk tales of the past. Cixin waxes and wanes from optimism and despair, destruction and renewal and yin and yang throughout. As with life, there is no fairy tale ending, the story just ends when it ends.I'm going to be thinking about this story for many years to come.
第158条评论: Synopsis:It’s a game of obfuscation in this second installment of the Three Body Problem. The one advantage humans have in the coming struggle is that Trisolarans cannot read their thoughts. To that end, four individuals are given almost absolute power, charged with individually coming up with plans to save humanity, and they’re not allowed to share the details of those plans with anyone. Each of these wallfacers devises a plan according to their strengths, and while their actions may seem straightforward and transparent, each harbors a secret agenda that might just allow for the survival of the human race. But those who have a vested interest in seeing the Trisolarans win form their own committee of four individuals, tasked with uncovering the plans of the Wallfacers. As secret plans are made and uncovered, humanity looms irrevocably toward disaster. Not only that, but the last wallfacer chosen, Lou Ji, is using his new-found power to live a secluded life of licentiousness, but for some reason, he’s the only wallfacer the Trisolarans want dead. Nothing is as it seems in this book, right up to the very last page.Impressions:Having been enthralled with the first book in the trilogy, this novel was harder to get through and less enjoyable. A large portion of the book is devoted to the love story of the protagonist, who should be busy saving the world. He’s not a likable character at first, and it took a little bit of persistence to make it through the first half of the book. But if you make it through that first hump, you’ll be rewarded with unfolding secrets, intrigue, betrayal, and catharsis. You’ll be left guessing up to the very end, when everything is finally revealed.
第159条评论: The first two books of Cixin Liu were phenomenal.  Can't wait to read the third. A beI.e. Of the universe that I have never seen. A must read
第160条评论: I've been looking for this alternate cover of the series since I finished the first book I bought in another country.  I raced through the first book and have been looking forward to this.  My book was delivered early and in great condition!  Thanks to momoxshop/medimops for amazing international service at a reasonable price!
第161条评论: Seriously great book. I will recommend this to all. It’s refreshing to read such a soo much different than the regular stomped on sci fi. Great job Lou!!!
第162条评论: I admit I found The Dark Forest, the second volume of the three-volume The Three-Body Problem trilogy (formally known as Remembrance of Earth’s Past) by Cixin Liu a bit of a slog at times.  I loved the first novel—its brief depiction of the Cultural Revolution, for instance, was brilliant and painful to read—and couldn’t wait to peruse the second. Despite the deliberate pace of the first half of the sequel, the images are often startlingly beautiful and the ideas ingenious.  The second half of the book has a fascinating realization of a future underground world (although I found it a bit difficult to imagine).  The conclusion was fabulous, and that made the entire novel worthwhile.The Dark Forest takes up the story of Earth’s planning for the Trisolaran extraterrestrial invasion introduced in The Three-Body Problem.  The Wallfacer Project is established by the UN to counter the ability of the Trisolarans to monitor all human communications: in it, four people are given virtually unlimited resources to create, within their own minds, a realizable plan to defeat the Trisolarans.  A terrorist group sympathetic to the invaders, The Earth-Trisolaris Organization, attempts to eliminate the Wallfacers by assigning each an assassin called a Wallbreaker.  One of the Wallfacers, Luo Ji, also realizes that the Trisolarans are trying to kill him via more direct means as well.  Eventually, many of the main characters of the story go into hibernation and awake two hundred years later when the first Trisolaran probe arrives in the system.  The final part of the book is about what transpires when the probe appears.The translation, by Joel Martinsen, isn’t as well done as the work by Ken Liu for the first novel.  Although I haven’t compared the original with either translator’s work, Liu’s translation was smooth and read like a well-written English-language work.  Martinsen’s translation is clunky at times (e.g., “Da Shi, you’ve really got a clear mind” [p. 484]); one is always aware that one is reading a translation.
第163条评论: I have been reading science fiction for over forty years.  I think I have had a broad exposure to all forms of the genre during that period.  After a brief hiatus, several years ago I dove back in; focusing on some of the newer authors, and have been very satisfied with most of my selections.  I try to read most of the Hugo and Nebula Award winners, and having done so, I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes outstanding science fiction.With all of that said, I feel strongly that The Dark Forest may be the best work of science fiction I have ever experienced.  I read the English translation of Cixin Liu’s Chinese science fiction novel, The Three Body Problem.  I thought that it was very good, but not excellent.  I was sufficiently intrigued to proceed on to the second novel of the trilogy, The Dark Forest, and I am eternally grateful that I did.  I am just floored by how good this novel is, on so many levels.I have read so many science fiction novels that are little more than spaceships and aliens, with poor underlying stories or character development.  The Dark Forest is an outstanding piece of literature, above and beyond its label as a work of science fiction.  It has very thoughtful themes, touching on philosophy, anthropology, sociology and psychology.  The advanced technology and elements of hard science fiction are outstanding, second to none.  The underlying story is absolutely captivating, as are the characters.At the conclusion of the Three Body Problem, we are left with an alien race, the Trisolarans, who have embarked on a four hundred year long trip across the galaxy, ostensibly to conquer and inhabit the Earth.  Through use of their advanced technology, they have arrested the technological development of the human race and are able to eavesdrop on every aspect of life on Earth.  Faced with this scenario, how does the human race respond?  As the years pass and different generations are tasked with coming up with strategies to face the threat, the author continues, time and again, to impress with his vision and the elements of human psychology and philosophy that he employs.Most impressive to me is the author’s ability to deal with these philosophical and technological themes in such a way that the reader can easily follow and appreciate.  To me, he walks the perfect line between being intellectually challenging, yet approachable (unlike some of Frank Herbert’s work, which was more than I could handle).So, if you have read The Three Body Problem and are trying to decide whether to proceed on to this second installment, I cannot encourage you strongly enough to do so.  If you have not read the Three Body Problem, I urge you to do so, with the knowledge that the follow up book will be worth the effort.  The Dark Forest wraps up very nicely and could easily be the end of the story; however this is a trilogy, so I will gladly continue to the final chapter, hoping not to be disappointed.  The Dark Forest is a terribly difficult act to follow.
第164条评论: It is rare that a second novel in a series doesn't wander around a bit before the plot moves forward in the latter half of the book.  It appears Chinese authors (a sample of one) are no different than many American authors (sample of many).  The story bobs and weaves through and around romantic attachments, dream states, traitorous affiliations, bureaucratic administrivia and sci-fi consumerism 2 centuries hence.  But, if you are able to wade through the  Chinese character's names (so many that the translator was compelled to provide a name reference in the forepart) and the "gee-whiz" Epcot-ish technology, there is a solid, active and cautionary science fiction tale that is a worthy continuation of the initial book.The Wallfacer project was interesting though lacking in subtlety.  Except for the approach of the protagonist, the alternatives were perhaps a bit more obvious or contrived than I would have expected.  In the case of Luo Ji, his obvious inscrutable nature was viewed by most observers as laziness or hedonism, and the author kept much of his thought process from the reader until the very last segment of the book.  I would have been a bit more interested to see his internal dialogue weighing theories and proposing alternatives to his selected course of action.The weakest part of the book, aside from the wandering subtended story arch, was threefold:  SciFi McGuffinism, Space Battle Tactics, Spaceship Earth Drama.  Early on, I began to wonder if the sophons were introduced to ensure that the author did not exceed his reach into speculative physics.  The more I read, the more this seemed to be the case.  We then encounter the probe. The "Teardrop" was never fully explained or brought into the realm of science.  Invulnerable, able to change vectors at definitive angles, accelerate to a considerable % of the SOL, compact, and with no identifiable power source, the Drop just didn't have enough science behind it to suspend my belief to the degree necessary.  It didn't fit with the generally good physics of prior speculative science in the novels.  The battle formation and commitment of our entire space armada to the close encounter with the drop was irrational for any military leader who read naval history. Lastly, when the remaining ships departed for deep space, it would seem that no one factored in the freedom from sophon influence that would allow the survivors to restart progress in particle physics and other closed-off technology areas.  All parties jumped to the default "final solution".++++++Nevertheless, the Dark Forest axioms on survival, limited mass and chains of suspicion result in a definitive philosophical treatise and are worthy of consideration in light of our present debates in the real world about broadcasting our presence to the galaxy.  I believe the author's work in this area is worthy of an important place in these debates, (perhaps ahead of Hawking group think).  His logic and arguments are not easily discounted.++++++++++All in, Dark Forest is a good novel that perhaps could have been a great novel if it had been winnowed down to the main story line with fewer diversions and more attention paid to the space battle/survivor section.  I've pre-ordered the final novel of the trilogy which is to be released in January 2016.
第165条评论: The science is compelling. The personal development end product feels right. But the actual  emotional or cognitive  evolution to get there is not shared.
第166条评论: Some of the writing and dialogue is a little cheesy and some plot points are a little predictable but overall its entertaining; especially the last third.
第167条评论: I originally ordered book 1 in this series after finding out that the producers of Game of Thrones were making the Three Body series their next big series for HBO. It also helps to have an endorsement from Obama on the cover, so I was all in. My overall feeling is this: the book is an incredible achievement, but WAYYYY too long, I mean probably 30% longer than needed. This author for whatever reason writes almost in stream of consciousness - he REALLY needs an editor. There is one segment in the book where the main character is taken on a 15 hour plane flight to an unknown destination, and I think it goes on for over 30 pages, just on that plane ride. Some of this could be from the translation, as other reviewers have mentioned, but regardless, any editor worth their salt would have cut that to 5 pages. As far as the book content, the science fiction aspect is excellent - very creative and massive in scope. I'm very impressed with how far the author has taken his concept of a potential alien invasion of earth. The actual "science" is so far fetched as to be ridiculous, but you can either embrace that or fight it. I say go along for the ride. As far as character development - if that's what you want, don't bother. I think both the author's poor understanding of human emotions, as well as the translator's huge task in translating those feelings from Chinese, make for a big mountain to climb. This will probably be one of the few book series that is better on-screen than on the page. Final thoughts: don't be afraid to skip pages at a time (I NEVER do this, but made an exception for this book), don't get wrapped up in the impossible "physics", and ENJOY! Looking forward to book 3!
第168条评论: Originally written in Chinese, there is an interesting extra layer of  complexity added on top of a complex plot. I found it entirely interesting. The sociological theories espoused are well thought out and lend an extra depth. They are quite thought provoking. Looking forward to book 3.
第169条评论: A bit of a rollercoaster of emotions but the last few chapters where everything comes together is a masterpiece. I'm looking forward to what book 3 brings.
第170条评论: The writing is superb , you really feel for the characters . While the overall concept i feel is not new, the author puts a new spin on things , including fermis paradox . Amazing writing , could not put it down .
第171条评论: I discovered Cixin Liu when reading his collection of short stories "The wandering earth" and I was completely blown away. Very rich ideas. The dark forest is the second book of his trilogy. It shows the earth preparing to face an annouced alien invasion. Working in a timeline of centuries he paints a broad canvas, getting broader still in the third book.
第172条评论: Author has interesting and exciting views about the nature of future human existence and the potential outcomes for extraterrestrial encounters. Well done!
第173条评论: Da Liu is a genius and I think this book actually reads better in English.My copy arrived with a big crease down the middle though. Not sure if that's the design of the cover.
第174条评论: First half of the book is really slow, and I almost gave up. Redeemed by the second half, and I will buy the 3rd in the trilogy finish it out.
第175条评论: I was really impressed at how the author is capable of creating a very long term view of what it would happen to humanity if we were to make contact with a distant civilization. Not just in the immediate aftermath of such an event, but in the very long term view. Must read if you like to reflect on what could happen with the humans in the following centuries.
第176条评论: Wow.  A tough read but worth it.  Really good at being way out there, thinking beyond the regular future plots and twists.  Some of the tech is really, really thought provoking.  And the hum behavior is spot on.
第177条评论: TDF serves as an example of wonderfully explained Science Fiction but is somewhat lacking in the development of its main characters.
第178条评论: The most creative and well-written sci-fi I've read in a long time. The scope of the plot line is tremendous once it all unfolds.  The author's mainland Chinese perspective adds a unique perspective as well. The whole trilogy is excellent, start with The Three Body Problem which I had a hard copy of.
第179条评论: The author outdoes himself in volume 2 of this trilogy. The first volume left me wanting more, and the same is true for the second volume. The author is very knowledgeable in physics, and his story hints at plausibility as his imagination soars to new heights. It will be difficult for this reviewer to wait for the release of the final volume of this fantastic and engrossing story. I already have it on pre-order!
第180条评论: I love this series!!!  This is an awesome read and a great series.  It's interrupted so there is a little clumsy narrative but it isn't very often and the plot makes up for it.  From the politics to the moral dilemma this is an awesome and way above average sci-fi.  I only buy hard copy of bools I really enjoy, this one is getting purchased in hard copy.
第181条评论: The best hard science fiction book I have ever read. It didn't leave my side for three days and I haven't slept to finish it. I've read thousands of books, and this stands above them all.
第182条评论: A very good sequel and view on the Fermi Paradox.
第183条评论: Wow!
第184条评论: Unfortunately the evolution is too slow for me, I feel really bored by the novel.
第185条评论: Wonderful! Book one was excellent - and this is so much better! Fast paced, wonderfully thoughtful, with an unexpected turn at ever corner. I cannot recommend more - but do read book one first!
第186条评论: This is book two of the series and us much better than the first one. Dinner very interesting ideas and plot twists
第187条评论: The concepts in this book are varied and complex. But the story is readily discernible and credible. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
第188条评论: Liu was able to blend action with science and emotions always zigzaging off in a direction you'd never anticipate. I enjoyed it and can't wait until the next one comes out.
第189条评论: Engaging, deep, thought provoking exploration of the implications of contact with an alien civilization. Well done!Definitely worth your time.
第190条评论: A little wordy, Can't wait for the final book
第191条评论: My favorite of the trilogy, this is definitely the most action packed in my mind. Great set pieces and Liu blends social commentary, compelling narrative and fun together into a resulting story that I practically devoured
第192条评论: This book is quite original and increasingly pleasant to read, as one advances through the story. Some details are truly remarkable. I have never read anything like this.
第193条评论: Couldn't love this book more!!!.  As with the first in this trilogy,very,very good.This isn't my normal genre of reading interest BUT, loved every word.The writing and characters are both top notch perfect. The concept is also a stand alone in an area where I feel there is over saturation.  Very,Very great.
第194条评论: Not only is this novel extremely well done, but the translation is excellent as well. Without the cultural notes to give the proper frame of reference much of this would not have made sense.
第195条评论: This book humbled me... just when I thought sci fic couldnt surprise me anymore, this novel did just that with its grand vision of the universe thru the author's lens of crystalline logic.
第196条评论: This book is in need of a better editor or translator.I really liked the first book.  The author and translator were able to convey a sense of unique thought that this book lacked.This book felt flat.  I think it was the translation  that changed too much of the author's intent.
第197条评论: The mind this author is like no other....the depth of thought, the non-western outlook both distinguish this unparalleled work.  Hard science fiction meets the mental anguish of trying to understand a galactic neighbor.  It was a struggle, but it gave me a strange peace at the end.  Now I have to rest....
第198条评论: This book was superior to the 3 body problem and it left you feeling deeply. I will not supply spoilers here, but some of the narrative is gut wrenching. This was worth slogging through parts of the 3 body problem. Imaginative and quite brilliant.
第199条评论: This dude is a sci fi superstar.  What's good is good. And what's great is this guy.  Cixin Liu.  How do you do.  The only thing that is tough for me as an American is that I keep forgetting who is who because the Chinese names are unfamiliar.
第200条评论: This series just blew me away.  Couldn't put it down.
第201条评论: This is a book I will remember. I don’t think it is perfect but the plot and the resolution of the plot are great. Characters are complex and a little overworked but the reader will appreciate them. I am looking forward to read the third book of the series!
第202条评论: This book is a masterpiece. The story flows perfectly, the twists and characters are as unpredictable as a believable story should be and the ending had my jaw on the floor. This book is why I love to read again, and  I hope anyone else who reads this gets as much passion about reading (or in my case listening) as I received from completing this wonderful book.
第203条评论: I drive long distances so I buy  a lot of Audible books this is the first one that sucked.  I do not recommend getting this book without buying the previous one.  Listened to the monotone narrator for a few hours hoping to make a connection.  One whole chapter is spent on an ants feelings about walking around various shapes.  I thought at first this was a book where you had to read the previous book to make the connections with the characters, but after 3 hours I could not connect to this story.  Literally had to pull off the road at a rest stop.  Listened for a bit and fell asleep, woke up and it was the same monotone words with no connection to any kind of a story.
第204条评论: A creative SF story that will  keep you guessing to the end. The Dark Forest is book two of a three book series. I look forward to the final conclusion to this author's creative genius.
第205条评论: This novel is definitely a bit of a journey of scientific theory and understanding, or at least it seems that way to someone with only a cursory knowledge of future science schools of thought. While definitely not the best novel to pick up when you just want a bit of light reading, this dynamic tale weaves a masterful story picking up not long after the events of the first novel of the trilogy. I was captivated.
第206条评论: I really liked this novel.  It was more technical than most novels and as an engineer I liked that.  It was also interesting to read a book written from a Chinese perspective.
第207条评论: I've read the entire series, and this particular book is honestly my favorite of the three. If you're a fan of science fiction, I would definitely recommend checking it out!! The writing doesn't feel translated, it flows beautifully in English, the character arcs are realistic and interesting, and the sci-fi concepts are absolutely fascinating!!!!
第208条评论: Fantastic follow up to the Three Body Problem. The Chinese author gives us different point of view from Western authors. but captures human nature - both as a collective and as individuals to a coming alien invasion.Unlike a lot of science fiction, this is rich with humanity as well as science.It ended to soon. I'm ready for the next book in the trilogy!
第209条评论: The first half of the book felt like a long series of “I am very smart” speeches.  I’m a female engineer in STEM and it hit too close to home.  I almost quit.  By the last quarter of the book, real events moved the narrative forward, and I’m glad I stuck around.Also, there’s an essay to be written about the author’s view of women and his use of them as characters, but someone else will have to unpack it.
第210条评论: The unexpected revelations put forth in the book will make you gasp. It’s frank portrayal of humanity’s response to first contact makes a lot of sense.
第211条评论: Just stunning, the ending was amazing and I will definitely read more by Dixon liu, they are a literary genius!
第212条评论: This was an amazing book, and I will be devouring book #3 Real Soon Now.Just some caveats--the Wallfacer program was a good idea, but why didn't they appoint more when the first two didn't pan out? Why didn't they appoint a 'Wallfacer' but have the real Wallfacer be Sid, who gets coffee? I can think of several sneakier ways to manage the program than shown in this book. I also think that modeling the brain so well could do more than just help people with their beliefs in victory.  That being said, I truly admired the bit with the 'meteor shower' for sheer ingenuity, I love SF with a different background than the typical upper middle class USA one, and this provides this extremely well.I was delighted by The Three Body Problem, greatly enjoyed this volume and will be inhaling the next one *soon*.
第213条评论: Quick service and the item wasn’t in good condition, it was in excellent condition!
第214条评论: I must say I was overwhelmed. I read the book during the night and from time to time I got goosebumps on my back reading -- I actually developed the urge to shout out loudly. The plot and main theme of this book were dark, deeply thoughtful, yet chilly and threatening. The cosmos picture presented by writer was choking yet powerfully convincing. The writer's description of main character's love affair is superficial, but the underlying theme -- that the cold survival logic in this dark universe is solid and refreshing. It doesn't offer any light-heartedness as we see from many sci-fi books, and yet it is not evil -- just the plain dark facts.I read both the Chinese and English version, and I found the English translation to be the top-notch. In any cases, the 2nd installment of this series is hardly Chinese at all (unlike the 1st one), It is meant for whole humanity.The pace of the book is extremely fast -- in fact, there are too many brilliant thoughts in this book, many of them could become a perfect main plot itself for a short sci-fi story.I can't wait for the 3rd and final installment of this series. When would it come out?
第215条评论: Truly amazing. So many science, economic, political, philosophical ideas expressed just in one book. I had a hard time reading the first book “The three-body problem” but it laid out a solid background for the second book. Loved it.
第216条评论: The Chinese ruthlessly persecuted defeatism and escapism to the extent of devising new horrible mind control techniques.  When the hero was forced to work by having his wife and child removed I put the book down for a long time.Americans know what happens when a technological  more advanced civilization meets one more primitive,  we saw repeating rifles against bows and arrows.  We would escape and hide to gain time to obtain advancement.
第217条评论: This sequel is as good as, if not better than, Cixin Liu’s first book of his masterful trilogy, The Three Body Problem. The writing flows from the micro to the macro with realistic plausibility. The opening scene is beautifully written from the point of view of an ant on a gravestone and by the end, following an intellectually stimulating narrative, the reader has expanded into the solar system and beyond. Liu connects events over fictional centuries and hundreds of pages, treating us to gratifying moments of illumination and understanding.Highly recommend this great book. Science fiction fans should especially enjoy The Dark Forest but it deserves a broader audience. The Chinese sifi perspective on the universe is an added bonus.Is the universe really a Dark Forest as described by Liu? I don’t know. But it could be.Jeffrey Penn May, author of Roobala Take Me Home

第219条评论: "The Dark Forest" is just techno- and psychobabble. The universe was created by an intelligent designer with four essential components 1. space/time 2. energy/matter 3. life/DNA 4. consciousness.  The universe is intelligently designed and cannot work as in "The Dark Forest" EVER. The science plot is the result of a confused CCP mind. Without all four components the universe is meaningless and would never have been created. Life and Consciousness (meaningful information) cannot appear by random mutations. Random mutations destroys information. Natural selection can only work on what is already present. The universe was designed for a benign purpose. Please study prof. Stephen C. Meyer.The reason I give this book two stars is I managed to read most of and that Liu give us a clear warning about CCP thinking about what their intentions are for our own civilization. Some hints of what is avaiting us.“Annihilation. That’s the highest respect a civilization can receive. They [CCP] would only feel threatened by a civilization they truly respect.”"You determine your actions according to possible outcomes. But for us, we must carry out our duty regardless of the outcome.""In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. "
第220条评论: It took me time and struggle to finish the book - the mixture of philosophy, phantasy, sociology, science and psychology was sometimes too demanding on me as a casual reader.  At times it seemed to me mainly as a disguised philosophy book - without the  logic part.  I struggled to finish it - but I am glad I did. I am taking a break though before embarking on reading the next one in the trilogy.
第221条评论: "The Three-Body Problem", imho, is better (I gave it 4*). It seems bloated and, at times, drags. The use of plot twists is so frequent, I learned to expect them at every development, large or small. After taking an enormous amount of time to develop the characters in 3-body, a number of key characters in Forest are almost cardboard and several appear to be the same character with little uniqueness. The author simplifies peoples' reactions to the extent that they do, repeatedly, stupid things, counter-intuitive at times, and even in defiance of their own regulations and understanding of history - does Trojan Horse mean anything? Does reasonable caution ever get urged? The answers all appear to be no. While there are still passages that are very well written (hence the 3 stars), if it was not for them I would have given this only two.
第222条评论: Cixin Liu has written a follow up that exceeds the original work in every way. The philosophy of man standing before impending doom and our relationship with a large dark universe is unparalleled.
第223条评论: TL:DR It was a 3 star until the ending. The ending totally made it 4 star and made the entire book worth it.I've got more to say:The world building is EXCEPTIONAL! The worldS building is exceptional. Truly. Additionally, the Cixin Liu is obnoxiously brilliant. I find Liu a genius. And, unlike 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle that I just finished, it certainly appears to me that everything is provided to solve the mysteries without assistance from the author. The fact that I needed help speaks more to my lack of hard science than his skills (I think).But you wanted to give it a 3? Yeah. I think that's more an issue with the translator than anything else. Additionally, it's hard to say, entirely, that it's the translator. That being said, the writing in book 1 was much better and the translation was exceptional. This is readable, but I guess I would suggest it's the difference between a NIV Bible and a Good News Bible: they may similar things but be completely ruined for the sake of "easy reading." ("Blessed are the peacemakers" vs "Happy are those who work for peace."** My Star Trek TNG - Data view says contractions are largely a human thing. (Anything more would be a spoiler.) And I'm sure there are contractions in Chinese, I just don't know how they work. But there are too many ... way too many contractions.How else to say this? In Book 1 when a particularly Chinese phrase came out, it was obviously Chinese but did not disrupt the flow. Here, it stuck out like a sore thumb and, because it was so blatantly not English, seemed like it was poorly translated.End of thoughts: The second of a trilogy often seems like a necessary slog to get from book 1 to book 3. This may also be true here. However, the ending as well as several surprising and terrible scenes certainly make this book do it's job: Make me want to read book 3.** Yeah, just because I'm largely agnostic does not mean that I'm entirely unfamiliar with the Bible. And this is a useful literary example.
第224条评论: The second book of this series, “The Dark Forest”, has its obvious shortcomings. The most glaring flaw I personally feel is Luo Ji (the leading character of the second book)’s romance with his “dream girl”. But how many engaging love stories have been told by scifi authors anyway? In addition, for American readers who have enjoyed the Chinese cultural/historical aspects of book one, reading The Dark Forest requires no understanding of the Chinese culture. Some of my friends also think that the Wallfacer project does not make much sense, but I disagree.This book deserves a five-star rating thoroughly. Unlike the Three-Body Problem that bears the burden of slowly laying the contextual foundation for the plot of the entire book series, the pace of The Dark Forest moves rather quickly from the beginning. There is no three-body computer game anymore. But a different game is played between four Wallfacers and their respective Wallbreakers. Each Wallfacer tried and failed in searching for a way to counter the looming invasion. Yet it does not seem to matter because, before the first alien fleet arrives, human technology has accelerated and risen to a level that rivals the alien race. Yes, inter-planetary peace is afoot.Part III of The Dark Forest is the climax and most dramatic stage of the entire trilogy series. Both Luo Ji and Zhang Beihai – two leading characters of the book – are awaken from century-long hibernation to witness the human race’s first physical contact with the aliens. I am not going to the details because it will spoil the fun of your reading. Suffice it to say there are several brilliant twists of the plot that forces the question: what is humanity after all? In my mind, the best scifi novels are not so much about the light-speed space dashing or spectacular galactic wars, but how we define humanity when facing an alien encounter or invasion. The Dark Forest just did that, in a chilling way. Almost like a social scifi, the socio-psychological elements give the book a provocative depth and resonanceZhang Beihai comes out almost as a Vulcan from StarTrek. Not only did he go undercover for many centuries, but also he came up with a shockingly unhuman solution to save the human race in the most dire moment. Morality is of no concern. Just another rational but dark choice in the face of desperation, which is quite consistent with the pervading sense of pessimism about humans through the first two books.This book presents an interesting theory about how different civilizations view each other in the vast universe, hence the reason for the book title “The Dark Forest”.  It’s similar to the famous prisoner’s dilemma where betrayal or hostility seems to generate the biggest rewards. The overall concept reminds me of the Inhibitors in “Revelation Space” by Alastair Reynolds. Again, the theory does not produce any good prospect for cosmic harmony. If u think the Three-Body Problem is a bit depressing, the Dark Forest gets bleaker. And of course, Liu is not done yet because the final installment of the trilogy is called “The Dead End”.The Three-Body Problem was the finalist for both Hugo and Nebula awards this year. I will not surprised if the Dark Forest actually win it. That’s how GOOD it is.
第225条评论: The follow up to the Three Body Problem is as good as the first.If you read the first novel the second does the same hard sci-fi while peeling back the mysteries left unexplored in the first.
第226条评论: From reading the user reviews here, I gather that this is not a book for everyone, which was also true with the first book in the series, The Three-Body Problem. However, I found this second installment to be as engrossing as the first, and in some ways, even more so. The translation of this book is more colloquial for English speakers than last time, and I quickly adjusted to the change in tone (although I liked the first book's translation too).Liu has a fertile imagination. He masterfully melds science fact with science fiction. He writes plot like Mozart wrote operas. His style runs the gamut from dry and declamatory to wildly evocative and romantic. He has human nature pegged, especially our habit of idealizing and handing our power over to dictators -- religious, political and social -- and the way this causes us to betray our higher ethics and values. His hypotheses on the consequences of space travel -- cosmic sociology -- are mind-blowing.This sounds abstract, but I'm avoiding spoilers. The Dark Forest is not abstract. It's concrete, loaded with complex characters, intrigue, irony and tragedy. The plot has many unexpected twists, but is easy to follow. We get to experience what space travel might actually be like for human beings a few centuries on. It's fascinating. It's not Star Trek, it's a lot more rough and tumble. Liu's solution to the problem of traveling at hyper speeds on a space vessel is truly amazing.This is a four-star review rather than five-star because the depiction of women is terrible. As a female sci-fi fan, I've had to accept that sexism is common in the genre. Liu's female characters were better represented in the first book, but the fantasy lover who turns up in The Dark Forest is like a blow-up doll that a guy might purchase at a porn store for personal use. Patriarchal stereotypes are not archetypes, they are an offensive shorthand designed to diminish the autonomous humanity of women. Still, I loved the book. Liu is brilliant despite his less-than-evolved perspective on women.When I learned what the title refers to, I was very moved. The explanation pulled together the many plot threads in an astonishing way.  I disagree with those reviewers who claim that Liu got lost mid-story and had to write his way out of a tangled mess.  On the contrary, the story's architecture was pre-determined and well constructed, and I had no trouble following it or finishing it. Travel through The Dark Forest and hang on for book three. It's quite a ride.
第227条评论: I just discovered Fixing Liu and was glued to his first three books. I ha e been a scifi fan all my life, read Asimov, Heinlein, etc all the classics, and this is really, really, good
第228条评论: Liu Cixin crafted a thoroughly fantastic and stunning follow-up to The Three-Body Problem with The Dark Forest. The tension from the final chapters of the first novel carried over well into the sequel. The Dark Forest excels in portraying a worldwide reaction to the certain knowledge that an advanced alien species had successfully cut us off from advanced scientific inquiry (by making it impossible for us to study anything at the quantum level) in order to keep us weak in preparation for the massive fleet that they had sent our way to take over our planet and escape the inevitable destruction of their own.Just like the first novel, the development of fully realized characters is superb, and the exploration of our evolving and devolving society during the couple of centuries after doomsday begins looming on the horizon is spectacular.The most striking element of The Dark Forest is in the application of the title itself as an ominous response to the Fermi Paradox. The concept that we aren't seeing evidence of alien civilizations because they are applying game theory to any other potential life in the universe is an interesting one. To announce one's existence to anyone else in the dark forest of our universe presents the very real risk that anyone receiving the announcement might be aggressive or induce aggressive response from one who isn't simply because they might assume that you might be. It's a sincerely horrifying prospect that there could be numerous civilizations out there who are just acting prudently in not broadcasting their presence and that there are other civilizations who might validate that concern by being a threat to any other life they might encounter. It's really fascinating to think of it that way. I certainly didn't think of that when I was writing my paper on the Fermi Paradox when I was in college, and I wish I had.The only problem I can think of with this book is that there seems to be a minor shift in tone and style from the first novel, but that could easily be due to there being a different translator involved with this volume. It'll be interesting to read the third book to see if that's the case, since it is translated by the same man as the first one.I honestly don't know where the third book might take me, because this one seemed to be such a perfect place to end the story...but I can hardly wait until the English translation is released later this year.
第229条评论: So in _The Three-Body Problem_, we are introduced to the Trisolarians, aliens whose home is inherently unstable and who intend to invade us in about four hundred years. Fortunately, we have warning. Unfortunately, they have used quantum entanglement and other physics magic (including an item I just plain don't believe in, the "sophon") to block human progress in fundamental physics. Furthermore, the magic sophons can spy on us and see and hear everything we do.So the world is preparing for a huge space battle, the "Doomsday Battle," knowing that, though the alien armada is technically advanced, and knows all our plans, it is limited in size. The UN institutes the "Wallfacer Project," in which four individuals are selected and given vast, discretionary, even arbitrary power to institute their plans - but they may not tell anyone what the plans _are_, or how they will stop the aliens. The Wallfacers are three world-class scientists ... and one Luo Ji, an academic who has transitioned from astronomy to sociology. Luo Ji has no idea why he has been chosen, and neither do the others, who don't completely respect him.Oh, and: the aliens have agents among humans. People who believe humanity _deserves_ destruction, or perhaps redemption, through alien conquest. This Earth-Trisolarian Organization (ETO) selects, at the behest of their Trisolarian controllers, three "Wallbreakers," one for each of the scientists. Luo Ji, we are told, will be his own Wallbreaker.One by one the three scientists fail. Luo Ji becomes ill and is put into cryonic suspension until he can be cured, awakening two hundred years later...to find a Golden Age, wherein humanity has produced a vast armada of fusion-powered ships ready to take on the Trisolarians. Their first test comes when a single, unmanned (unaliened?) advance probe arrives ... and wipes out the human fleet.This throws humanity's last hope on Luo Ji. I won't say how the book comes out, but there _is_ a third book in the series, so draw your own conclusions.Cixin Liu is not really like any of the classic Anglophone science fiction writers - he is, however, rather like all of them, in his ability to take wild stfnal ideas and spin out their social and personal consequences to create engaging stories. If I had to compare him with anyone, it would be Asimov: characters slightly deeper than Clarke's, but as intellectually rigorous as Clarke.Do read the first one first!
第230条评论: If you like really grand conception scifi, I predict that this will be one of the truly great exemplars, up there with Dune, Foundation, or Octavia Butler's tetrology on Doro and his legacy.  In other words, this is a once-in-a-decade reading experience.  It's that good.The kicker is that it is by a Chinese writer, so is distinctly different than what we in the west are used to.  As such, the story and concepts are continually surprising, even strikingly unpredictable.  I could never foresee what was going to happen, where it would go, or what the final solution would be.In this one, mankind is waiting for the arrival of the Trisolarian annihilation fleet.  Scientific research has reached a deadend, due to an alien device known as sophons, hence in all probability Earth weapons will be no match.  Meanwhile, as the protagonists emerge from suspended animation, the world has reorganized itself, going through many phases and panics; the entire international system has evolved as has human language.  A space fleet has also developed, with its own motives and culture.  It seems that a single mysterious intellectual may hold the key to humanity's survival, but what or how remain impossible to discern until the very end, when the Dark Forest is explained, even positing a resolution to Fermi's paradox.The novel is not perfect.  I found character development weak, not in the sense of their interesting ideas, but I could not empathize with or like them.  Many of the technical explanations are too long and convoluted, however important they all are.  Though I got hooked sooner than in the first one (which occurred at a full 3/4 of the way through), this time it took about 1/3, when it finally clicked and I couldn't put it down.This is the best scifi I have read in many years.  I give it my highest recommendation.
第231条评论: The second book of the three body problem continues to expand on possibke solutions to the problems of the first book.
第232条评论: [No spoilers] This is a review of the entire Three-body Trilogy, "The Three Body Problem", "The Dark Forest" and "Death's End".If you thought you'd read all the best sci-fi ever, add this one to your list. After you've read Asimov's Foundation series, and every Iain Banks Culture novel, what else is going to impress? I'm glad to add this trilogy to that mental list of the best of the best. Epic, but with continuity of characters, human, but also social, with a wonderful writing style (even as a translation) to boot.Just wonderful.
第233条评论: Excellent sequel to the Three Body Problem. When the Earth is on the brink of invasion and civilization has lost any hope, Dr. Luo Ji, a Chinese astronomer, and the first cosmic sociologist in history,  finds a way to force the invaders to turn their fleet away.I took one star away from the rating because there's a very long scene in the first part of the story (about Luo imagined lover) that has ,in my opinion,little influence on the development of the plot . No doubt that CixinLiu is a great writer.
第234条评论: First 15% is a bit slow compared to book 1, but definitely DEFINITELY worth it. Science actually plausible, and philosophical elements are deep.
第235条评论: This is the third time I read the trilogy. First two times in Chinese, this time in English. Every time, I was left in awe by the author's immense scope of imagination, and the epic depth of his thinking.I said back in 2008 when I first read the book that this level of stuff is going to win China her first Hugo/Nebula award. This year, Liu Cixin's Three Body Problem proved me right. If you liked the Hugo winning Three Body Problem, this follow up book is even better!Really looking forward to Ken Liu's translation for the final and the best book of the trilogy next year. All three books of the trilogy deserve international recognition. Can't wait for the movie adaptation to come out soon.
第236条评论: This book is densely packed with details and characters that never really link up to the main story in any interesting or moving way. I think probably Liu had a very clear idea about where he wanted humanity's story to go by the end of this book, but then he ended up building a fairly bloated vehicle to reach his destination.The prose is also substantially worse than in the first book; I think partly Cixin Liu is so focused on the many details that never end up mattering that he also, for the most part, neglects to work interesting imagery into the book, and I think partly the new translator is probably just not as good as the old one.It does become pretty interesting and enjoyable and well written, at least, once Liu nears the end of the book — I think he finally stops focusing on immaterial details, and finally starts writing interesting scenes, once he begins to show us the plot points that are interesting to him.
第237条评论: I read “SevenEves” and really enjoyed it, and like anyone else that catches that feeling of being unable to put a book down, I wanted more of that..I slogged through Diamond Age, I bailed on a China Meiville book after 30 pages... just not in anyway the same experience.This book is incredible. It is that “can’t put down”.“The Three Body Problem” was very enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it anyone that likes sci-fi. But “The Dark Forest” takes it to another level entirely. Don’t miss this... seriously.
第238条评论: Normally in a trilogy of books, the middle book will drag out and have a ton of superfluous material.  This book doesn’t have that at all.  I never anticipated the end and I’m looking forward to book three
第239条评论: I am no literary critic but have read 100's of sci-fi book over the decades and this is a true gem for those who like 'hard science fiction' rather than action science fiction or fantasy science fiction.  This is true literature not just an action book (action books are fine by me--but this book seems highly literate to me, an untrained reviewer.  I believe that I will have trouble finding another sci-fi book that is more thoughtful, scientific and moving that this book and it's so interesting because it' from a non-Western perspective.  I have already read the first two books in this trilogy  twice-both times with great joy!
第240条评论: I was thinking whether it would be possible to keep the same thrilling pace comparing to the first book. Since it is common that we have  very interesting entry point  while sequeles end up being pretty the same and hence boringThe whole series have new concepts and subject plots which I have not imagined before.  Thanks to the author for keeping tye pace in quality mystery writting.Although there is one golden line across all of his books which is outlined in the epilogue for the Three body problem
第241条评论: Worth the lost sleep. Deals with bigger philosophical issues and sprinkles just enough hard science to feel at home in the near future. A book that makes you think. The ending comes full circle for a satisfying end.
第242条评论: I know it's a translation but parts were a little far fetched and some characters were a little flat
第243条评论: So good.  Such a good read.  Really opens your perspective
第244条评论: Read it!
第245条评论: Unlike some reviews, I enjoyed the writing style. I'm looking forward to the third part, due ib September.
第246条评论: Best Hard Science Fiction ever
第247条评论: Very good books from a great author!
第248条评论: absolutely loved every part of the story and the way it forced me to question my own generally accepted beliefs.
第249条评论: Amazing book and amazing series, but my problem is with the physical book itself.  There is a printing error on a couple of pages that caused ink to smudge part of the page.
第250条评论: Epic. Very thought provoking.
第251条评论: NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BOOK
第252条评论: What more could I say? Just read it.
第253条评论: Good
第254条评论: This was an incredibly fascinating and imaginative read. Extremely realistic yet out of this world sci-fi. Great second edition to the series.
第255条评论: I love this series and can't wait for the 3rd volume.  Intense Sci Fi with twists and science and unexpected ideas.
第256条评论: Almost as novel and clever as the 1st installment of the trilogy.
第257条评论: Mind-bending, thought provoking, slow burn of a hard science fiction epic. Will leave you mulling and pondering for days afterwards.
第258条评论: Much more enjoyable than Three Body Problem.  The author seems to be hitting her stride now, and I'm looking forward to her third book.This is definite Hugo Award material.
第259条评论: Slower than the first book in the series. Long stretches of description. Flowery and poetic language not usually seen in science fiction.
第260条评论: Could not put it down.
第261条评论: Great and different science fiction.
第262条评论: It would be helpful if Amazon would mention higher up (or anywhere on this page) that this is the second novel in the Three Body Problem trilogy.
第263条评论: Best sci-fi I read in current generation !!! Pick one up and read
第264条评论: It blew my mind
第265条评论: THE SPLENDID SCI.&FICT. STORY THAT EXPANDS MY SIGHT TO FAR DISTANT FUTURE.
第266条评论: To be specific,Character: 2.5 stars (Two for Zhang Beihai)Writing: 3 starsRest of it: 10 starsAlright, link deleted.
第267条评论: Great book. Better than the first in the set I would say. The writing was very good and the storyline was fresh and interesting.
第268条评论: Is all fiction about the future dystopian? Are all eras of humanity equally fixated on apocalypse?As Charles Eisenstein describes in his latest book, "Climate," it is not an end to civilization that we must fear, but rather, a dead planet. Liu would seem to agree.Much of the book focuses around the concept of wallfacers—individuals that must defend against an alien invasion but know that their actions and words will be fully surveilled. Their minds are the only safe space.The concept of wallfacers seems a uniquely authoritarian concept. The concept illustrates an extreme concentration of power.The concept that we can never know if wallfacers actions and words reflect their truths; this bears striking similarity to all people. People regularly behave in either unpredictable or counterintuitive ways. It is one of their attributes that makes communication so challenging.The most disturbing aspect of this books is Liu's assertion that life expands endlessly towards domination. Most indigenous peoples don't exhibit this behavior, nor do other forms of intelligent life. It is a dangerous kind of capital-centrism—a world view that ascribes all civilizations across the universe to have capitalistic tendencies.The ideas we explore—fiction or otherwise—have a magnet pull. You might think of Liu's book as propaganda for a dead earth, and because of this, I don't like it.
第269条评论: This book is full of surprise and fascinating ideas, and the main plot completely changed my thoughts about the universe and aliens. Absolutely recommended.
第270条评论: Good book according to hubby.  He read it.
第271条评论: The first two thirds of the book could be removed and the story would lose nothing. I assume it was just the author trying to figure out what to do with the story, realizing what they wrote was going no where and then deciding to just stop and skip ahead. A good author would have just started over or removed it. Anyone can write dribble that goes no where and parts I and II go no where and add nothing to the story. Part III of the book has its own challenges, mainly that everyone is an idiot. Idiots to the point that the story becomes unbelievable. Imagine if a character decided there was no gravity based solely on their own wishes. So they decide they want to fly around since there's no gravity. They start marching up the stairs of a building to the roof so they can fly off. Completely ignoring the fact that waking up stairs is proof of gravity. They get to the roof, winded from their long climb up.  Stepping up on the ledge of the building they jump off. Guess what happens? If you answered "fly away" you'd be a character in Part III of this book. If you answered correctly "fall to their death" you're too smart for this book, read something else.
第272条评论: The Dark Forest fulfils all the potential flashed in The Three Body Problem (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQO403K?ref_=cm_cr-mr-title) while overcoming its deepest flaws and adding much, much more.There are three major positives here: it is a good holistic story in the way it pits humanity against the technologically superior Trisolaris. Author's cleverness in forming something ingenious benefits the story countless times by adding new, unpredictable twists and turns but they do not shadow the story-telling. (spoiler alert) Beyond the fiendishly clever humanity advantage and concepts of the Wallbreakers, the first three of them are shown to come up with plots worthy of the burden assigned to them. The author manages to outdo himself by still trumping all of these failed attempts with the last Wallbreaker who is otherwise with no chance whatsoever until the last pages of the book.The second positive is in ensuring that readers connect with the main characters. The underdog is shown almost contempt-worthy through the book but the reader is likely to still want him to succeed against all odds to save the Earth. It is a story of the clashes of civilizations and yet it is still about a set of individuals involved in the battles.Lastly, the book has its own world with its own philosophy and its own science, all combining to its own morality. The book moves from being extremely dark and fatalistic, defeatist, escapist most of the times to almost rousing full of hope by the end.And there is more: with "spells" that destroy stars to the indestructible probe, the machines that map minds to spacecrafts that turn on each other, a sharpshooter in vacuum, suicide bomber plans and even guerrilla war militants - this is a book packed with thrills.An absolute classic.
第273条评论: SPOILERS AHEADMy main gripe with the story centers around the conclusion. If all it takes to prevent the Dark Forest situation (and allow two civilizations to coexist) is mutually assured destruction (MAD) by a third, and more advanced, party, then it stands to reason this would have happened many times already across the history of the Milky Way and beyond. There's no logical reason the MAD scenario only works for a pair. It could extend to MAD alliances between a large number of races, leading right up to the point that eventually the "chains of suspicion" are broken simply through spending a long enough time together that you know you aren't out to kill one another. Because of this, IMHO, the Dark Forest idea doesn't explain the Fermi Paradox.
第274条评论: Brilliant read!! I went through the 3 books over a week, with the Death's End being the magnificent culmination to the series.The book is literally teeming with ideas; and each of them in the hands of another author would deserve a book in its own right (multi dimensional weapons, the fairy tale...I don't want give out too many hints!). Where Liu really does well is when he is exploring an idea and thinking through and laying out a fairly logical response that the humans might take and then just running with it. For instance, I loved Wade's character and how his response seemed as natural as that of any of the other characters. The other area that this book in particular shines is that it is just so amoral and in fact when morals come into the picture (Cheng Xin's decisions are all what we would think is 'moral thing to do') they are ruthlessly taken advantage of and killed.That being said there two areas where I thought the book is at its weakest (1) the descriptions of the future (tree houses, bunkers) felt very derivative. The bunkers' description seemed like Clarke's Rama series. Liu is on much surer ground when he describes hard physics and humans' responses to it, and less so when trying to evoke just mundane future living environment (2) ending just felt too safe and a bit of letdown from the mind twisting pace and ideas of the rest of the book. He could have pushed the book's dark forest idea to its logical end.However, all said and done, this series is an awesome ride and every 50 pages. I was astonished at Liu's imagination! There is so much that the book forces you to think about, and our childlike naivety feels positively dangerous to our survival! And like all great books of fiction Death's End forces you to reconsider your beliefs.
第275条评论: As with its predecessor Three-Body Problem, the author has some great sci-fi ideas which differ from other books I've read.Also as with its predecessor, the book is by & large not even close to gripping in storytelling, and character development is very poor.I am listening to the audiobook (the narrator is outstanding), and am on part 12 of 21 (this is a long hard slog).  I almost tabled this book at the end of part 8, however the author turned to a couple of those great sci-fi ideas.  So I listened on, although now I am once more ready to table it.The book is very mechanical and does not pull the reader in, and the characters lack anything below the surface.In Three-Body Problem, I eventually -- eventually -- came to appreciate the detective character.  In this book, I'm halfway through it and the jury is still out, even for the protagonist who might become interesting someday.  But in the first third of the book he is entwined in a dull, creepy, imaginary love affair -- this is painful listening.I do not understand the high ratings here.  I am well read in science fiction, and I enjoy Stephen King, enjoy Reacher, enjoy Longmire, and appreciate the brilliance of The Sixth Extinction and Sapiens.Whereas this work is simply not engaging.- - - -Update:  I completed audiobook part 12 of 21, and then successfully put this book down, so to speak, and deleted it.  I've begun Lee and Andrew Child's The Sentinel, and the first three minutes alone have demonstrated a whole lot more character development than all of Three-Body and half of Dark Forest.It's very nice to get back to something engaging, and again, the high ratings here for Dark Forest don't make sense to me.  People are inflating their marks here, to be sure.
第276条评论: Luo Ji's romance with his imaginary/actual lover was hard to get through. I am willing to contemplate multiple theories about the author's motivations for writing it, from satire, to a demonstration of just how self absorbed Luo Ji is, or even cultural differences that are hard to bridge. Whatever the reason it was uncomfortable and I'm sure it will turn many off. Beyond that section of the book this is (just like The Three Body Problem) world class science fiction that raises the bar. Brilliant concepts, well executed that keeps you on your toes start to finish. I loved it.
第277条评论: Second book in the series. I don't think one could enjoy this book without having read the first, The Three-Body Problem. The trilogy is extremely creative and expansive. Sympathetic characters and innovative science.If I could attempt an amateur summary sentence, "Dark Forest" refers to a way of conceptualizing the social character of the universe: mysterious, ominous, hidden enemies, not knowing if a predator is lurking, that sort of thing. It grew on me as the characters worked through the story.I think the translator is admirable, as well.
第278条评论: The first half of Cixin Liu's novel The Dark Forest (a follow-up to his Hugo Award-winning book The Three Body Problem) is a very good science fiction story. It's well-written, it begins with an intriguing, ant-centric (you'll see) prologue, and it gives the over-worked "alien invasion" plot an original twist.Then, just about halfway through, Cixin Liu pulls off what really good science fiction can do: he suddenly makes you wonder W T F is going on. I won't reveal exactly what happens, but from this point on, The Dark Forest turns into a fantastic, mind-spinning science-fiction-roller-coaster-ride. This second half of the story is weird, wonderful, dark, harrowing, and ultimately very satisfying. The way humanity's confrontation with the Trisolarans plays out - as both Earth's fate and Luo Ji's plan are revealed bit by spine-chilling, mind-bending bit - had me turning the pages frantically to find out what would happen next.I won this first-read copy of The Dark Forest in a Goodreads giveaway earlier this year, and haven't even read The Three Body Problem yet, but I will definitely be reading it now. You can read The Dark Forest on its own - enough of the previous plot is explained in the book - but Cixin Liu's writing certainly has me intrigued enough to sample his other work.
第279条评论: This is the second book in a three part series. You should read them in order. Otherwise it will be hard to make sense out of some of the characters.The only criticism I have deals with the names of characters. I don't know how to pronounce Chinese names. Consequently, I had difficulty keeping track of who was who. Some phonetic guidance or use of English equivalent names would have been helpful. Nevertheless this is a good book and a good series.
第280条评论: Uneven. Sometimes too much science without moving along the story. But, I still enjoyed the book and would recommend that others read it.
第281条评论: This Chinese author offers a very original take on tHe alien invasion story.  He takes into account the vast distances between stars without using the Wormhole or Hyperdrive plot device.  Humans have four hundred years to prepare for the invasion fleet but still aren’t ready.  The Dark Forest refers to a possible answer to the Fermi paradox.
第282条评论: It deserves 5 stars. If we say the first book of the trilogy is a hardcore sci fiction, the second is not only a hardcore sci but also a hardcore sociology and psychology Game Theory fiction. Skip the boring romance, all other parts especially the last part are fascinating. Welcome to the world of plots. Yes, everyone could have a plot. What you see is not what it could be. Taste the despair, more and more despair, and then......
第283条评论: Expertly written, with grand strategies, science and far reaching concepts. Makes me want to learn Mandarin so I can meet Cixin Lu.  Even exceeds Asimov.
第284条评论: I could not stop listening
第285条评论: Liu Cixin's first book in this series -- though not without its flaws -- was extraordinary.  Of this, the second entry in the trilogy, I'd say: though not without its extraordinary moments, the book was overwhelmingly flawed.  I'll cite just one glaring case in point: the first 300 pages or so are pretty awful: cliched, boring, bizarrely/poorly imagined, wooden characters.  In the last 200+ pages, things get considerably more interesting, but it was only on account of other hang-in-there-it-gets-better reviews I read that I decided to stick it out.  The Dark Forest was one of those very rare books I find so completely tiresome early on that I'd seriously consider calling it quits.  When Liu Cixin is good, he can be amazing.  But The Dark Forest richly attests everything that can, and not infrequently is, so mediocre in his writing.  True, some fault might lie with his translator.  But the most glaring faults in this book have to do with elements outside any translator's control: plot and character development chief among them.  It will be a long while before I commit to the third entry in this series -- a shame, since it started out so brilliantly in book one....
第286条评论: A great sequel, as very good or better than the first one. Rich, full of turning points and interesting characters. A solid plot, with plenty of meaning without being too cheesy
第287条评论: Mostly what it is, is *different*.You watch a Hollywood action movie, you can expect main characters to behave a certain way, events to go a certain way, governments or corporations to act a certain way.  It's not the way things go in *real life*, but it's the way things go in a Hollywood movie, we're used to it.In "The Dark Forest", people and organizations also do not act the way they do in real life.  But it's using a different set of conventions and expectations.  Lots of things in this book have the sound of cold-war Communist dialectics, or of Chinese folk tales.  Government officials place a top priority on instilling the proper ideological zeal in their people.  Characters say things in conversation like "Emancipation of human nature inevitably brings with it scientific and technological progress."  People go on lengthy trips with companions who do not actually exist.The scientific imaginings are a mixed bag - one bit involving some very different kinds of spacecraft (trying to avoid spoilers here) is brilliant, lots of other things are kind of silly, it really depends on how you like your "hard SF".Certainly worth reading, at the very least to see what all the excitement is about and to see some of those very different ways of telling a story.
第288条评论: Amazing book phenomenal premise and riveting execution.  Ciu crafts a world that feels tied to our own but from a perspective we are not usually hearing from. Highly recommended
第289条评论: I liked The Three Body Problem. This sequel was only so-so. The beginning was very slow, it picked up in the middle and I didn't find the ending satisfying. I think I was expecting something grand for the end from the reviews and had I had lesser expectations I might have given this one more star. The plot was not great and the character development not as in depth as the TBP (esp. Da Shi and Ye Wenjie who I thought were fascinating characters). Both people are in this book but play a smaller role with less interesting involvement. I also found certain issues around technology and the actions of the aliens harder to suppress my suspension of disbelief.
第290条评论: Unfortunately the author's other novel "ball lightning" was not translated yet, it's like the preceding story of this trilogy that presented some characters like Yi Din in his earlier life in discovering " magnum electron" who will appear in the 3rd trilogy again.I've been reading many novels, "ball lightning" is the only hard core Sci-fi fiction that's mind blowing while being so romantic, The trilogy of three body problem is great - but it gradually slipped out of control in its last episode. The cosco picture that Liu tried to draw is just impossible to cover in just a trilogy.  To me "ball lightning" is the best of Liu's work so far, I've read it too many times and felt touched every time I reach the end of story.
第291条评论: Just read it!
第292条评论: I'm very much enjoying Cixin Liu's trilogy and would recommend it to SciFi fans.
第293条评论: One of the best modern authors I have read in years!
第294条评论: Even more engaging than the first book! I can't wait for the third. Brainy page turners always appreciated!
第295条评论: Cixin Liu tells a wonderful and complex story in this second of three books. Great science fiction.
第296条评论: Ok....just...ok..ct
第297条评论: This has some overly long sections that should have been edited but the concept is very good.
第298条评论: Brilliant conclusion, and twisty as usual 😎
第299条评论: even slower than the first book...
第300条评论: Must read book series.
第301条评论: Finished the 3 body problem and ordered this right away
第302条评论: While there are many reviews out there I’d like to add a few words.First Cixin Liu’s writing is new and refreshing, not news to anyone.The last third of this book flirted with becoming predictable but averted it. However one can not but think if China of yesteryears, it’s current state and future aspirations to lead the world are reflected in the story of earth rising several times from its ashes like the Phoenix.
第303条评论: I don't know, all the acclaim is possibly justified, but after the first in the trilogy, I'm stopped cold. I mean, reading this is just a steep uphill climb through ankle-deep mud carrying your body weight in a backpack. I put it down and pick it up long enough to read a couple of pages about people I just can't care about doing stuff I've lost interest in. I started reading the first and last pages of each chapter and skimming what's in between. I've even read two books in between! (I'm a science and nature essay fan.) I decided finally to force myself to read this through, like completing a term paper I'd put off, and knocking off the interim reading.The second in this series is just falling on its face, in my estimation. Trouble is, I want to read the complete trilogy: An author that wrote the first terrific piece of fiction deserves thorough appreciation of their efforts. But I look at the "Dramatis Personae" and I just kind of wilt inside. Having to flip back and forth among a bewildering crowd of characters in such a glacially slow-moving book just plain wore me out. A large cast of characters who people a piece is not a problem for me, but coupled with a book this ponderous just makes for a sleep aid sans the side effects. (If I *ever* get through this book and am pleasantly surprised, I'll update my reply.)
第304条评论: The beginning had moments where it was a slog to read through. I kept hoping for more and desired the promise laid out in the first book. But before I knew it the book had shaken me to the core. It went far beyond my wildest predictions and satisfied so many conditions I didn’t know I wanted from this book. Halfway through the book, I thought it could never live up to the brilliant storytelling of the first book, but by the end it was leaps and bounds ahead of the first. This book was chilling, depressing, terrifying, and exciting all at once. It realized sci-fi in every way my mind had conceived the genre but solidified it into a polished work of literature. It’s like the movie Hot Fuzz where it just ticks every box of crazy concepts possible but in sci-fi.
第305条评论: I absolutely loved the first book in this series, and as such was pretty interested in reading this follow-up. Unfortunately, while I still liked it, this just didn't hold my attention quite as well for much of its length. This book sees humanity coming together to attempt to deal with the coming invasion from the Trisolarans, who have already done much to hamper our ability to do so. As such some pretty creative solutions are needed, and this book comes up with one in the Wallfacer project, which is best learned about by reading it. Once that plan is in place, we follow our main characters as the consequences of their actions play out over centuries. The long time scale of this novel allows for some pretty impressive imaginings of Earth's future in a very specific situation, but this also leads to the central problem I had with it; that at times it felt like I was reading a "history" more than an actual story, which bogged things down quite a bit for a large portion. Things pick up at the end, and when they do the book becomes especially enjoyable, providing more of the breakneck pacing and deep thinking that I liked so much in the first one. The Dark Forest theory that the book is named after especially lingers in one's thoughts afterwards. I still came away having mostly enjoyed my time with this book, and it does leave me wondering just what will happen in the 3rd and final installment.
第306条评论: This book seems to pick up where Three Body Problem left off & paints a very realistic picture of the political, military & scientific climates on Earth after learning of the impending alien invasion. Overall I really enjoyed this part of the story. I found the characters to be enthralling & the world he presents feels genuine.I would say I enjoyed the previous book more. This one contained a lot of setup, probably the first 12 hours of 15 hours of audio was world building with the last 3 hours containing the climax & action. I can see where the climax would not have been as poignant without the setup, therefore I don’t fault the author for it.There were a couple issues that bugged me. First off, this story felt much drier than the first, although there was a surprising amount of beauty & metaphor in his descriptions. I think the dryness comes mostly from the style of the narrator in the audio book. I also felt like some of the sentence structures & word choices were awkward; are there a lot of phrases/words in Chinese that don’t have s good English counterpart?Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who has finished 3BP. It’s a good continuation of the story.
第307条评论: The plot, ideas and prose won me over to a 5 star review. I overlooked any awkwardness or πλημελη in the translation in the beginning because of the strength of these three things. Cixin Liu is the Thomas Hobbes of science fiction. He basically founded Interstellar Political Theory and explained it by using Da Shi, a no-nonsense cop, who acts as a Socratic interlocutor, in the book's philosophical climax.The philosophical portions of the book reminded me of Lem's Solaris, which is my favorite scifi book even though it has come to me through an English translation of the French from the Polish.Thomas Aquinas only had Aristotle's works through Latin from the Arabic from the Greek, but he could still see the deeper ideas in Aristotle clearer than most during his time. So, too, with anything with deep ideas when translated.I recommend this book to anybody that read the first book, and/or likes Solaris, although Solaris is philosophically denser and richer.
第308条评论: I'm still reading book 3, but I had to take a minute to come back and say Cixin Liu is a genius. Book 1 of this series, The Three-Body Problem, is an imaginative and quite original book that deserves all the awards it has received. But, even with all that being true, it doesn't hold a candle to The Dark Forest which is in my opinion in contention to be the best sci-fi book ever written.I'll tell you how good Death's End is when I'm done with it, but (if you haven't) buy book 1 today, and if you've read the first one and are not sure whether or not to continue, think no further. This trilogy should be required reading in schools. Liu is the first author I'm aware of to reach the heights of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. In fact I think he's better than Clarke and gives Asimov a run for his money.Liu's take on the Fermi Paradox in this series, particularly the second book, is so consequential that it makes his detours into discussions of euthanasia seem almost frivolous in comparison. He has probably invented an entirely new field of study in these novels. (He calls it Cosmic Sociology.) Along the way he dispatches themes like gender identity; loyalty; the relationship between being a sentient/intelligent species and being a culture or a people; the relationship between totalitarianism and democracy in times of crisis; the meaning of culture; the potential soul of atheism; nationalism; the hypocrisy of popular demands; the burdens of leadership; the relative importance of the environment; child rearing; the tugs of war between love and duty; death vs. living forever; faith in the future; and a bunch of others as if they were mere footnotes in the grand scheme of things, hitting you with revelatory meditations in almost every chapter.
第309条评论: Bought on Day 1 and finished on Day 3. It was a fantastic Sci-fi reading experience from beginning right to the end. You just couldn't stop feeling surprised and stunned by those choices and decisions made by the characters all the time, regardless they matter or not. The unthinkable scope of the plot and sceneries just repeatedly stroke your imagination and nerves like forever. Twists and turns in both large and small scale are blended into the whole logical story-line, which is so well-arranged that it turns out to be better than a mind-bending blockbuster movie.Comparing with the first volume, the new translator localized the writing in a more "English" way, making the reading for English speakers feel like reading an original Western literature instead of an Eastern-Western translation, which may not be too good for "preserving" the original writing, but... there isn't too many Chinese culture/history related content in this second book anyway.One more thing to add, unlike vivid human beings appear in regular full-length fictions, most characters Liu sculpted in his works look like symbols instead, which I fancy is on purpose, being probably the only "obstacle" for this book in the way of becoming a true saluter to those real Classics back in the Golden Age of Science Fiction.Definitely a powerful Hugo/Nebular contender and a likely winner next year.For your own sakes, read it yourselves.
第310条评论: If we live in a finite galaxy with finite resources, would it not be logical to be wary of strangers? It would take time and energy to learn to communicate...set up diplomacy. Simpler just to kill and take.This may be why we don't see our galaxy teeming with smart  species zinging about the stars talking on radios and broadcasting messages across the cosmos.However there is a very advanced civilization that has made contact. They are coming and they are not friendly. It will take centuries to arrive.This forces humanity to ask some very fascinating questions. Do we fight? Do we capitulate? Is humanity worth saving? If we do not fight, do we escape?The Trisolarans have managed to stop all scientific advancements on earth. Sophons monitor our every move. The only thing the Trisolarans have no access to is our minds.To a Trisolaran thinking is speaking. They cannot lie to each other.Humans are at a disadvantage. Not helpless.This the fascinating story of how we respond
第311条评论: Thought provoking and draws you in. A bit long winded in places. Enjoyed the political and social fiction as much as the scifi
第312条评论: IN ORDER!  Wonderful trilogy! Master story teller!  Many thanks to the translator for bringing this to the english readers of the world.
第313条评论: the dark forest paradigm has applications in many situations:  business, exploration.. a truly great book.
第314条评论: Follows up from Three body Problem but it gets closer to the future, the atmosphere is slightly more varied and there is a feeling of time progressionAgain, excellent book
第315条评论: interesting.
第316条评论: long winded, but an excellent read, especially for an old and jaded SF reader like myself.
第317条评论: The story develops slower than I am accustomed to but I kept feeling pulled along and felt it was well worth the time to read.
第318条评论: I thought the book started out slow but it really built up.  Great sequel I'm downloading the next one now.
第319条评论: Good finale to the series.
第320条评论: A wonderful twist of the explanation for the answer to the Fermi Paradox. Fascinating introduction to the Eastern mindset focus about science fiction, great reading!
第321条评论: I read this a few weeks ago and I'm still finding myself randomly, suddenly paralyzed with terror at how tiny we are in the universe.
第322条评论: This book is ambitious and full of thought material. I was hesitant to read a Chinese science fiction novel at first but was surprised.  This is better than other sci-fi novels. It's intelligent and thorough.
第323条评论: A few amazing images but poorly connected. A good editor would have helped.  I had high hopes but the flat character development/ vast amounts of filler// or lack luster translation/ or ?  frankly i hoped for a more coherent tale. The basic premise could have been scary as heck and brilliant. Reminds me of later KSR.
第324条评论: The critics are correct with this SiFi and it's phenomenal story teller. If you worry about humankind and the future, this book may cause you some stress. However, I still bought "The Three Body Problem " which is 1st in this tale that sometimes keeps me awake. Find out why it's so dark!
第325条评论: This trilogy is an incredible read. I didn't want it to end. With Cixin Liu andhis plot twists, I'm expecting this story to continue as long as humanity isable to continue in the Cosmos! We must always hope! Only the Creatorhas the grand plan.CWE
第326条评论: Amazing imagination! The second book of the trilogy after THE Three Body Problem is a better book than the first. Top notch science fiction.
第327条评论: Brilliant but there were some plot holes and i didnt like the simplistic conclusion that solved the problem is a few pages. Otherwise, brilliant book.
第328条评论: Much better than its predecessor as an actual novel, I didn't want this book to end.Again, full of hard science, but with fewer characters Cixin Liu shows some actual emotional depth.
第329条评论: Marvelous story and written so well. One of the best SF books I ever read. The translation is also excellent. The characters are well developed and the science is explained very well. The last book has been ordered already and I look forward to reading more by Mr. Liu.
第330条评论: Think Foundation Trilogy, 2001, Ender's Game, etc. A very different take on the 1st-contact genre. Well thought out, definitely a dark view of the cosmos. This is not your friendly ET trope. In addition, interesting insights into post-Cultural Revolution China. I am waiting eagerly for the third book coming Sept. 2016.
第331条评论: This guy is just too smart for my reading tastes I think but very innovative
第332条评论: Captured my interest early and held it. By now I have learned to accept that I will not fully comprehend Liu's concepts.  And that is awesome. Liu takes the reader beyond what they currently conceive and reveals a new horizon of concepts. Thanks, Bro.
第333条评论: Another book in the trilogy by Cixin Liu.  A worthy successor, but not quite as mind blowing as The Three Body Problem.  If you loved the first book, you have to continue and read this one.
第334条评论: Book is well paced and really comes together nicely in the end. My eyes have been glued to it for days now, so I'm not sure how I'll return to normal life, but I'm really glad I've read it
第335条评论: It's better to judge this book as part of a trilogy as it's a bit weak on its own, but the story does build up neatly and wrap up well despite a slow start. Definitely recommended for its stronger emotional impact towards the end.
第336条评论: What can I say? Not since I first read the Dune series 30 years ago have I felt so "off-world" and totally immersed in Sci-Fi heaven! I cannot look at the night sky the same again and not think of the dark forest out there. WOW!
第337条评论: Good read and a logical extension of the story. Nice use of hard science as well. A little bit long.
第338条评论: Interesting concepts presented in a sometimes obtuse way. Lots of explication and light on action; nonetheless, epic in scope and endearing in its world building. Characterization is functionary while the conceptualization of the Trisolaran civilization is both abstract and grounded in science as we currently understand it. A good read for those who like philosophical or spiritual elements with their scientific theory. Avoids overt anthropocentrism in its description and explanation of the alien civilization.
第339条评论: Great product, quick shipment
第340条评论: I enjoyed both books immensely.  Some of topics were a little hard to grasp, however this book kept me engaged through the end
第341条评论: Starts slow, but well worth sticking out to the finish - sort of like life , really!
第342条评论: This second book in the Earth's Past trilogy is inventive, gripping and fluidly translated. This is an unusually creative novel that consistently takes the reader in well-crafted and very unexpected directions. Cixin Liu is a master.
第343条评论: This is actually my favorite one of the trilogy. Luo Ji and Zhang Beihai are fantastic human beings.
第344条评论: I am very happy to have discovered the English translations of Cixin Liu’s novels.  They are imaginative and very well written.  I look forward to reading more.
第345条评论: When I reached 30% of book contents, I was sure that was the best sedative I've ever had - 5 minutes reading and then happily zzzzzzz..... But something was familiar about this feeling.... in my youth, I had to read books like that  - hey, that was that! I had had to read so called soc-realist books at school, it used to be obligatory in communist era! One idea for the plot, usually simple. (not here, plot is twisted enough, but why, oh why do these twists take so much pages?). Lots of explanations, partly they consitute the boring speeches of main characters. One very proper hero, undeterred by harsh twists of the plot (usually dies). Dire complications always end by some "deus ex machina" and the sun shines and humanity strides happily into sunny future.What was particularly unbearable for me? Condescending upon readers.Skip it. Loss of time and money.
第346条评论: A complex tale, well told. Complex people, science fact and fiction woven into the fabric of the story. Deep and thought provoking. On a different, higher level than 90% of what I find online.
第347条评论: As the title says, i enjoyed this book. I stayed up annoyingly to complete it one night, so i feel like that is a pretty good compliment.
第348条评论: Here’s the scenario: A distant civilization in the galaxy sees they’re doomed if they remain in their unstable trisolar system. They’re desperate to find new digs, but there’s nowhere to go. Someone sends a misguided invitation to Earth, so they notify you they’ve packed their bags, and they’re on the way. Don’t make a fuss; they’ll take care of you when they arrive. It will be as easy as spraying ants with a can of Raid. They’re way, way, WAAAAY more advanced than you. They can communicate with individuals on Earth, see and hear everything you’re doing in real time. They’ll be here in 450 years to kick our ass. How do you make breakthrough leaps in technology? How do you keep the planet motivated for 15 generations so no one throws in the towel? How do you keep internal factions from squandering resources? How do you combat internal agents from sabotaging your plans? What do you do? You’ve got 450 years to work it out. Go.I like this series. It postulates an interesting crisis scenario and proposes how the modern world may respond to it. You can feel the distressed atmosphere caused by the approaching invasion as the world scrambles to formulate ambitious survival plans. Although the writing (or maybe it’s the translation) isn’t stellar, the ideas are very smart. To fully appreciate it, you need to step back from the writing and think about the ideas. It has everything there is to love about sci-fi. It’s full of scientific, psychological and sociological exploration with multiple twisty threads, although the hard science part doesn’t really kick in hard until after the first third. In fact, you need to be a little patient with the first third of The Dark Forest, and you’ll be rewarded for your patience. The first part is still very good, but the latter parts are what science fiction is all about, and it’s a steady, fun ride until the end.I enjoyed how The Wallfacer Project dangles 4 concealed solutions in front of you with only a few clues initially but prolongs their final bizarre reveals at checkpoints throughout the novel similar to the unfolding of a mystery novel. On the cringey side, the hero of the story comes across as a creepy pedophile. His driving force is his disturbing, infantilized fantasy of a woman. In general, the women in this novel are highly objectified if they exist at all. Women are weirdly absent from The Dark Forest, until someone must have told Liu, "Hey, you forgot about women." because he threw in a female starship captain at the very end, although even she held just a minor role. Like The Three-Body Problem, the story mechanics lean heavily on science and technology. Unlike The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest storyline has just a single focus on what to do about the oncoming Trisolaran onslaught, but unexpected turns of plot kept me guessing to the end. The pace picks up during the second half in this regard, but it comes at the cost of flat characterization. Characters in the second half of the novel come across as simple props to drive the hard science ideas. Overall, I enjoyed The Three Body Problem a little more than The Dark Forest, but the last third of The Dark Forest was simply amazing in terms of pacing and imaginative sci-fi storytelling. Quite honestly, I could care less about small transgressions in the writing/translation. It’s smart and imaginative with thought-provoking ideas that transcend the writing.
第349条评论: bought as gift he loves it!! always got nose in book! must be decent :)
第350条评论: It is an excellent novel showing a grand view of time and space.
第351条评论: I enjoyed this book very much. Even though it gets very technical at times, u can still keep up. Yes.
第352条评论: A parable that spans Eons and I believe can help us begin to glimpse issues that span time and are hard for us to grasp and so are easy to ignore. But that continuing to ignore them could cost us our future.
第353条评论: I read the first book and was blown away. This one is translated by someone else and I can tell. Full of awkward sentences. Knowing how beautiful The Three Body Problem was, I know it must be the translation. I noticed the third book goes back to the original translator. Looking forward to reading that one and getting this one over with.
第354条评论: The first book of the series was an interesting allegory on China and its current state. This is just as interesting to read with a storyline that grabs you but the allegories are more grand and relate to the earth as a whole.
第355条评论: There are moments of immense beauty and creativity here, building on the fantastic opening of the series. I thought it was slightly slow in the beginning, but picked up quickly in the last 1/3. Looking forward to the conclusion.
第356条评论: Thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking read that I looked forward to throughout its carefully crafted unfolding. Thank you for taking the time and effort to craft this trilogy.
第357条评论: brilliant, thought-provoking, very original. Not a action adventure, but a calm, deliberate, slowly unfolding plot introduces the reader to some very heavy and existential concepts that may be critical to human survival someday, during our eventual contact with ET's (I'm only half kidding). The translation is spare and elegant, and retains (I imagine) much of the tone and atmosphere of the original Chinese, which is also interesting. The axioms of "cosmic sociology" introduced here could be as famous as the Three Laws of Robotics, and are arguably as important for popular imagination as we move into the next century. Everyone should read this.
第358条评论: For me, I got entirely gripped by this series during this book. Amazing. I loved these books so much that even though I had purchased them for my kindle, I got the hard copy as well to decorate my bookshelf. If you have read the first book, I highly highly recommend reading this one. If you are not yet fully immersed in the world, you will be soon.
第359条评论: Thoughtful, clever, daring. Liu takes one of the staples of SF, alien invasion, and breathes new life into it. I had Alexa read it to me, and I admit I strung it out as long as I could. He's got multiple strands and he keeps them all under control. Part of the book's charm is its Chinese roots, like the profound blow the Cultural Revolutions dealt Chinese society. They often give it a very subtle oddness, an interesting unfamiliarity. Given the ending, a sequel seems impossible. And that is exactly what I expect from this author.
第360条评论: Epic space opera that offers intricate storytelling with the highest stakes constantly snapping and snarling on every page. The writer introduces characters that face hopeless odds and personal obstacles. Echoes of Asimov, Heinlein and other masters in the scale of the story. The ending in itself is a masterpiece of storytelling.
第361条评论: I love this book so much. My one issue isn't so much with the product but with the delivery. When my package arrived, the front cover had been bent in half. It created a really ugly crease down the front of the book and now the cover isn't completely straight.
第362条评论: So many turns and twists and the author still managed to get to a great ending. I felt the grief and the joy of each turn!!
第363条评论: A must read for any hard science fiction fan. This one is a little slower but sets the stage well for the rest of the trilogy. This book gave me messed up dreams in the best ways.
第364条评论: Amazing book. Equal to the first. Thoughtful, creative, wonderfully done. This is quickly becoming my favorite sci if series.
第365条评论: This review is for the entire trilogy (The Three Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death's End). Despite starting the series with great anticipation, on the recommendation of a trusted science, and science fiction, fan/friend, only determination, not desire, allowed me to complete it. Admittedly, it's been some months since I finished the third installment, as my reluctance to give a poor review has delayed this writing, and so some details are fuzzy. In general, I found the characters difficult to connect with, and I don't recall a single strong character who is present throughout the telling, around whom the reader can organize the story arc. The writing overall is often more science than fiction; as an avid reader of science non-fiction, I could follow the story as the physics moved into extra dimensions, but the fiction part, the story being told, was not engaging enough to hold my interest. While I can understand how these books could be very appealing to a reader, I guess this time, I am not that reader.
第366条评论: This was a very enjoyable experience in reading.  Along with the first book, The Three Body Problem, it is a deeply thoughtful read.
第367条评论: I don't even know how to start.  This series can only be described as "beyond".  I think I went through a psychological and philosophical transformation after reading this series.
第368条评论: yes it is that good.
第369条评论: This book is so good I can't even tell you how good it is. You just need to read it. It is mind expanding. I think about it consistently 7 months after reading it. Obviously you should read the other two books first, but do yourself a favor and check this out.
第370条评论: This book was a really intriguing sequel to a book that I found incredibly thought provoking. It is perfect for any sci-fi fan who wants an interesting, long-lasting read.
第371条评论: For veteran science fiction readers this is revelatory. Great new ideas about galactic civilization. Profoundly arresting characters presented with artistic depth rarely seen in our literature. For novice readers of science fiction, a warning, you will be disappointed by almost everything else you ever read in this genre.I've been reading science fiction avidly since the early 1960's, and I heartily endorse Cixin Liu. What a read!
第372条评论: Hard to say too much without spoilers.  I think I need to go watch some ST:TNG to regain my faith in things.
第373条评论: Absolutely a fantastic story. Immensely imaginative. Especially love the author's deep thoughts on combining sociology and science, and his vivid presentation of the doom's day scenes. Put it on a very short list of my best sci-fi readings so far. Highly recommended. Already pre-ordered the final installation of the trilogy.
第374条评论: Might be a barrier for some given that it is translated, and you can feel a non-Western philosophy and temperament throughout. However, one of the most enjoyable and novel books I've read in a long while.
第375条评论: I was really into the concept and storytelling style of Three Body Problem, but this one topped it. I have no idea where the third book is going, but I'm exited to find out.
第376条评论: Still, second novel also very good reading. Had much fun with these weird ideas about future contact between humans and aliens
第377条评论: Loved the story, finishing the 3rd book shortly
第378条评论: Tremendously engrossing and the author has an unbelievably creative mind. It is sUchiha an incredibly interesting read and really thought provoking as well. This is an amazing trilogy.
第379条评论: Beautifully written.  Luu Cixin has created a page turner that causes one to stop and ponder the idea of the dark forest that exists out there.
第380条评论: Great hard Sci-fi.  Can be a little drawn in places but is great overall, I read the who,e thing within the day unable to do anything else, glued to the screen
第381条评论: A bit less riveting than the first book, but I felt it had a lot more action.
第382条评论: Interesting idea
第383条评论: Awesome!
第384条评论: This series is amongst the best sci-fi I've ever read.
第385条评论: I read the first few chapters and skimmed through about one third of the book...but i cannot find anything of interest.Incredibly boring, glum and obtuse.And I've actually already read the last book in the series.  Perhaps knowing the nihilistic ending makes this one even more superfluous.
第386条评论: Some of the best true Sci-Fi I've read in many years...can't wait for the third volume (or learn Chinese).
第387条评论: Cixin Liu's imagination is seemingly endless and amazingly detailed. The trilogy is a truly outstanding story.
第388条评论: Fantastic book second book in a thought provoking triology!
第389条评论: Really interesting ideas about a possible solution to Fermi's paradox... Highly recommended, would read again.
第390条评论: As described, thanks
第391条评论: Price
第392条评论: I read this in Chinese a few years ago, was awestruck. I  have read all winners of Hugo and Nebula awards, and thought this book definitely is among the best, and exceeds all others in its scope and imagination.But what resonates really deeply is Liu, who spent his life as an engineer in a power station in a small remote city in China, did not let his environment constrain his genius and imagination. Imagination and the desire for a broader horizon were what drove many of us Chinese growing up in small cities and towns in China in those decades, and our lives are better for it.Amazon should have 6 stars!!
第393条评论: This is an outstanding book that is the second in an extraordinary trilogy.  Cixin Liu wriites science fiction that is truly “science fiction”. It is solidly based on physics and then extended out to limits of imagination. I’ve read all three books in the trilogy and each book is better than the last. You must read them in sequence. Absolutely some of the best science fiction that I have read in a long time.
第394条评论: I have owned the series for a little over a year I think, and I've already read it twice.  This series is just the best.
第395条评论: I’ve attempted ordering this book twice now — both times I have received a copy with black ink smudges and issues in the printing/cutting. Fair warning that these Amazon copies are from a print-on-demand company who clearly does not do their due diligence in terms of quality control. Disappointing.
第396条评论: After the reader invests themselves in the story of the Trisolarans and Earth Civilization in the Three Body Problem, the second installment in this three part epic science fiction novel starts to introduce the truly monumental concepts about cosmic sociology that define this book. The Dark Forest is truly a terrifying place, and the thought experiments that spin off from reading this book leave you begging your friends to read it so you can find a forum in which to discuss them!
第397条评论: The trilogy itself sets a new and higher standard for “hard” (science based more than fantasy) science fiction.  Only reason I didn’t give 5 stats is I didn’t feel the Joel Martinsen translation flowed as well as the Ken Liu translations for first and third books in the trilogy.  Just a tad harder to follow.Love the book though.
第398条评论: I think it's a difficult book to evaluate. At times I found it boring, but suddenly it becomes interesting and moves quickly. The end is absolutely brilliant, I loved it. I think the conclusion saved, in my opinion, the whole book. The explanation of the "spell" could not arrive at any other time than at the end. Really awesome.
第399条评论: While I felt the book stalled in a number of places, and I still didn't really care if any of the characters lived or died, I was interested to find out what happened.The deep blend of science fiction into the plot is fantastic.
第400条评论: Chinese Science-Fiction.  This seems to have bridged the gap between the (seemingly) neverending SJW vs. Sad Puppies groups.  It's solid, hard-core science fiction but manages to make the people issues more important than the spectacle.  It's definitely got me thinking about digging further into the sub-genre.  Heck, it's got me seriously thinking about learning to read Chinese so I'm not dependent on translators.
第401条评论: At first I struggled to get through this, but the ending was lit!!!!
第402条评论: I don't have to say anything, already finished Chinese version. A must read sci-fi that will blow your mind.
第403条评论: Fascinating story. An excellent and surprising second book in the Trilogy.  If you like hard science speculative fiction combined with deep ideas about human nature when confronted with the unknown, this series is for you.
第404条评论: I recommend this book - great read, I don't want to spoil or set expectations,
第405条评论: Good book great insights into cultural revolution and Chinese society and great original idea and premise
第406条评论: Hard science fiction at its best! At some points slightly slow, but the story is thrilling and the end quite surprising. A must-read.
第407条评论: This thought-provoking book left me utterly fascinated, crying, and wanting to converse with others who also loved it to explore its depths.
第408条评论: Riveting. Great story telling and compelling solution to the fermi paradox
第409条评论: A bit heavy on exposition, but best read it quickly; the details can be difficult to follow.Best take on the Fermi Paradox ever.
第410条评论: An excellent book. A challenging read for those with an agile mind! This man has a bright future ahead of him.
第411条评论: For a sequel it’s outstanding
第412条评论: Very slow and uninteresting in the beginning, nowhere near as good as the first book.  I had to force myself to keep reading.  It does get more interesting once the Wallfacer project is introduced, and the final third, once it jumps ahead 200 years, is fantastic, at the same level as the first book.  So keep reading, it's worth it.
第413条评论: This series is one of the most superb I've ever read, up there with the Foundation Trilogy and Piers Anthony's Macroscope.  That it is a Chinese author adds a bit of alieness to the writing (to Amercian eyes), which enhances the narrative.  Very highly recommended.  I can't wait for the third book to come out
第414条评论: I enjoyed the sense of magic realism that reminded me of Garcia Marquez and Murakami. And having been written by a physicist, the science rings true. Well done!
第415条评论: One of the better science-fiction books that I've read. Interesting ideas, fast pacing and an overall fun read.  This second book in the trilogy is better than the first.
第416条评论: This was impossible to put down. I can't remember the last book like this that I would stay up all hours of the night to continue reading.Great sci-fi and characters I enjoyed taking the journey with.
第417条评论: The Dark Forest is the 2nd book of the Remembrance of Earth's Past series. I have finished all 3 books now. If you like Three Bodies Problem, you must read the Dark Forest. The plot is even better and bigger, and the characters are good.
第418条评论: How can he do this? After the first book I thought it could only go down hill. This book is even better than the first. This author is truly something else. His imagination and thought process is way ahead of his time.
第419条评论: my review is one of thousands given for this series.  what a mind has this author!  the 'cry out in the dark' 29 star map ... is chilling.  Cixin's imagination is as big as the real universe.
第420条评论: great science,  a great unpredictable adventure. I love the Chinese perspective and Chinese history intermingled. Wonderful character development. Lots of unexpected twists.
第421条评论: I wish more of this author's work would be translated. The story about first contact is profound in terms of its portrayal of human nature under these circumstances, which is only a reflection of intrinsic human nature itself. The characters have amazing depth, consistency, and believability.Looking forward to the third volume in the series
第422条评论: Great story!!!
第423条评论: Great read.  Well thought out science.
第424条评论: I don't read much. However, this book (and trilogy) is just too darn interesting.
第425条评论: Quick delivery. Excited to read
第426条评论: Best nonfiction series ever. Eloquently written intellectually stimulating.
第427条评论: Interesting story. well developed characters. Excellent mystery and irony.
第428条评论: Greatest science fiction book ever written.
第429条评论: "Three-body problem" got great reviews.  I read that, enjoyed the perspective on the cultural revolution, but couldn't see much of interest in this book.  Essentially endless exposition.
第430条评论: So many innovative concepts in this book. They have spurred many discussions in our family. They have even entered in how I hear things on different subjects.This series is heavy on concepts, and they move the story forward more than the characters in it. That is why the three stars.Liu definitely reaches the level of Asimov in his science and social theories in this series.
第431条评论: Best Chinese Sci-Fi so far! Looking forward the 3nd one of the series.
第432条评论: Great continuation of the series. The story flows well, is well researched, and is impossible not to stay engaged with the story and characters. The prose is occasionally a little stilted due to the translation from Chinese to English, but I think this is intentional to keep the original feel of the Chinese prose. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in "hard" science fiction.
第433条评论: Disappointing. The rickety wooden plot telegraphs the central denouement from a hundred pages away. There is much more expository bloat, and all the female characters are embarrassingly (to my western viewpoint) submissive, subordinate, and paper-thin. At one point there is a description of an unplanned (human) interstellar voyage, and unfortunately one cannot help but to compare it with Robinson's Aurora, released this year, a superior book that meticulously describes why this Would Not Work. Ken Liu's absence is felt as well--he did an amazing job with 3Bod. Not a horrible book but surely not a Hugo winner.
第434条评论: The solution to the problem of the dark Forest is set out almost immediately in the book, yet most readers will probably only solve it at the pace of Luo Ji
第435条评论: Liu's investigation into collective psychology began in the previous book, but comes into full flower here with exacting detail. This isn't a mere fantasy, but is instead a fully-realized strategy and explanation for dealing with our corner of the galaxy, which we should be very, very, very cautious of shining our flashlights around in. Exploration carries many dangers. One of the greatest of these, is our hope for a better future.
第436条评论: LOVE the concept of the “droplet”. Incredible “battle” between the droplet and the space force. This is even better than the first book!
第437条评论: The book was a little rough getting into as I had reacquainted myself with the characters.  But once I got into this book man it was great.  This book explores a humanity seemingly without hope and a future that has not been explored before.  A great read
第438条评论: LOVED this trilogy which is seductive to the reader.  After the 3rd I was looking for more.  If you do too, pay attention to the translator(s) as ther are multiple.
第439条评论: Really cool and creative sequel to "Three Body Problem". The selfish, confused, but likable main character was a refreshing change from your run-of-the-mill hero. I never saw the ending coming, but it truly brought the story to a conclusion, something that so many novels lack.
第440条评论: I can guarantee you that the conclusion of this book will impress you.The presentation of the concept of The Dark Forest to explain interplanetary relationships hit me as hard as Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.
第441条评论: Incredible story, like the rest of the trilogy. Translation clearly left something to be desired compared to the first and third book which were translated by Kevin Liu.
第442条评论: Concepts were interesting, but ultimately the fatal flaw of this book was the characters were unrelatable and female characters in particular were grotesque.
第443条评论: Very smart.
第444条评论: Great book. A must read.
第445条评论: Great book...lots of science.
第446条评论: Strong if quirky continuation of the trilogy.
第447条评论: great book
第448条评论: Utrolig fengslende bok.
第449条评论: Slow in the beginning but absolutely phenomenal
第450条评论: Extraordinarily EPIC.
第451条评论: Amazing book, must read for SciFi fans
第452条评论: Must read for any fan of hard sci-fi and those new to the genre, if you're coming from fantasy style sci-fi, this is a good entry point. I think some people might be dissuaded by the fact the author is Chinese and many of the characters are as well, but I really enjoyed the perspective shift this gave me as an American reader. Overall this is a fantastic series and I look forward to finishing the third book soon. Honestly I read books one and two in about three days each; they are hard to put down!
第453条评论: It’s been a month since I finished Dark Forest and I am still thinking of it. The concepts and key moments are not only bright in my mind they also have become more enchanting with time.Slow to start, but trust the process. You’re lead down a path that is extremely rewarding and throughout, never dull.I’d give so much to be able to read this book for the first time again. I literally stayed up all night reading this book.
第454条评论: I didn’t love this book as I felt that a better story could have been conveyed with a more rigorous process of editing.  I found myself unable to slog through some sections, as they seemed merely to add complexity to the characters, something that failed to deepen them or make their actions or story any less predictable or interesting.Im wondering if this is a cultural issue with respect to stories written in Chinese vs English, my language. This represents only the second Chinese book I’ve read so I’m not sure. I didn’t think Three Body Problem had the same issue to the same degree.
第455条评论: Thoroughly enjoyed this through and through. An outstanding book that I am happy to recommend to the masses, both those who typically enjoy science-fiction and those who do not.
第456条评论: Enjoyable book, this is like a modern mystery novel, Contact, and Independence Day all rolled into one. It is a must read. I’m impressed with Cixin’s sci-fi he blurs the lines science so well using what only exists in theory today. As an avid reader of non-fiction physics and astrophysics subjects I found myself wondering if I had missed some major scientific breakthroughs.
第457条评论: There is nothing I would like to emphasize more on the exellence of this book as a science fiction for it is already reviewed positively by so many people.I would like to emphasize Ci Xin Liu's perfect elaboration on humanity. (spoil alert)  1. Luo Ji wakes up and the world no longer needs a wallfacer.  2. The star he marked was destroyed, Luoji became a savior.  3. The sun was locked and signal couldnt be sent, people started to hate him (threw him off the bus).  4. Just days later Luoji came up with another launching system and saved the world..savior again.  5. People started to think Luoji is a dictator for holding the launcher that controlled entire world.  6. People replaced Luoji with a Blessed Virgin  and put him to trial...AND THERES MORE IN THIRD BOOKMy friends, this is human....and we dont changeMaybe Ye Wenjie was right?
第458条评论: This is the 2nd book in a trilogy. It is a wonderful combination of science fiction, physics, and Chinese philosophy.The Three-Body Problems describes and sets up the foundation for book 2, The Dark Forest. In Book one there is a Three-Body computer game. However, there is the situation of "Wallfacers and Wallbreakers" The Wallfacers are to design a solution to the incoming invasion from Trisolaris - but they need to do it in such a way that Trisolaris cannot understand what they are doing. The Wallbreaker is to "break" the solution that the Wallfacer is designing. We observe each of the 4 Wallfacers approach to the looming disaster. It is a chess game on a cosmic scale.Both Luo Ji and Zhang Beihai – two leading characters of the book – place themselves in century-long hibernation in order to awaken and witness the human race’s first physical contact with the aliens.
第459条评论: It's been a long time since I read a book series this good. Thanks to everyone who helped make it a reality.
第460条评论: For big ideas this series by Cixin Liu is hard to beat. Assuming there are multiple civilizations in the galaxy, how would they respond to each other? What does it take to negotiate a stalemate between alien species? And what would some possible future paradigm shifts in physics allow people to with technology?At 500 pages the book takes a while to get to the point and the translation often feels bumpy. Things get better after the first third of the book -- no more multi-page UN speeches -- but there are still many moments where the dialogue is just awful, and it is hard to tell if it was written that way or translated poorly.Ultimately I judge the book by its ideas -- I'm still thinking about them days after finishing it, so that means a lot.
第461条评论: This is science fiction at its best. Compelling story, intelligently written, and the translation was really good. I’m into the next I. The trilogy and it’s just as interesting and enjoyable. Highly recommended.
第462条评论: Amazing book
第463条评论: Excellent
第464条评论: Truly awesome.
第465条评论: This is the second book in a trilogy that starts with "The Three-Body Problem."As "The Dark Forest" opens a large fleet of hostile Trisolaran aliens is headed for Earth, destined to arrive in 400 years. Presumably this is when the 'Doomsday Battle' will occur between the human race and Trisolarans.Humans are aware of the danger but are hampered in making preparations because the aliens have sent 'sophons' to spy on Earth. Sophons are souped up protons that (due to quantum physics) can INSTANTANEOUSLY transmit every single thing humans say and do to the Trisolarans. Thus, the aliens can 'hear' all discussions about how to combat them and 'see' all weapons being developed. To make matters even worse, the sophons have blocked technological advancements, curtailing Earth's ability to develop the most effective/advanced weapons systems.The Trisolarans one weakness is their inability to read human minds. Thus, the United Nations institutes the 'Wallfacer Project' in which four individuals - called Wallfacers - are instructed to develop a strategy to fight the Trisolarans. Each Wallfacer is to work alone, write nothing down, and use evasive measures to flummox the Trisolarans. The Wallfacers have almost unlimited resources with very little accountability, so they can do pretty much whatever they want. And one Wallfacer seems more concerned with having a comfortable life than with fighting the Trisolarans.The Trisolarans, in turn, designate four humans sympathetic to their cause to be "Wallbreakers" - whose mission is to sabotage the Wallfacers' plans. The Wallfacers are very clever and inventive, but the Wallbreakers are pretty smart too. (The author has clearly done a lot of research for these books.)Around the time this is going on some humans - including people with serious illnesses, a couple of  Wallfacers, and various professionals - are put into hibernation. The plan is to awaken them at a later time when they can be cured and/or be useful to humanity.Skip ahead two hundred years. Some hibernators have been revived and Earth looks very different. There are well-designed underground cities as well as large fleets in space, which are now considered to be separate 'countries.'  The Trisolaran fleet is due in two centuries, but the aliens have launched a fast 'probe' which will arrive any day. Oddly enough, people seem to be relatively optimistic. Some think humanity will win the Doomsday Battle while others believe the Trisolarans might turn out to be friendly. Surprises abound after the probe enters the Solar System, and things take a rather dramatic turn...all very exciting.There's a good deal of philosophical underpinning to some of the plot developments.  For example, 'escapism' - the plan to launch some people into space to preserve the human race (just in case) - is outlawed, presumably because there's no fair way to decide who will go. Is this right?And when there are limited resources and too many individuals, what should be done? And IF the Trisolarans are defeated, should alien survivors be treated in a 'humane' fashion?  (This debate reminded me of American Indian history as well as the movie 'District 9.') All things to think about.I found the story a bit dense and slow-moving but overall I enjoyed the book, which is full of inventive ideas and interesting characters. I don't think it's giving away too much to say that - at the end of book 2 - there are still humans and Trisolarans. I'm interested to see what happens in the final volume of the trilogy.Overall, I'd highly recommend this series to science fiction fans.
第466条评论: great writer!
第467条评论: Amazing book
第468条评论: The Dark Forest is a sequel to the 2015 Hugo Award best novel winner, The Three-Body Problem. This series was a best seller in China and has been translated into English by Ken Liu (first and third volumes) and Joel Martinsen (this volume). Historically, American science fiction fans have not paid much attention to works published in other languages (with a few exceptions like Stanisław Lem). This has changed recently as the field has grown more accepting of diverse cultures.The Dark Forest may be a better book than the first one. It has all of the sense of wonder large scale idea-driven science fiction that drove The Three-Body Problem. But it also has an interesting character in Luo Ji, a lazy hedonist who just might be right person to save Earth from the aliens.The setting is the near future. Mankind knows that an invasion fleet from the Trisolarans is on the way and will be reaching Earth in 400 years. The aliens use a subatomic particle to spy on humanity while simultaneously blocking any future scientific advance. Since the aliens can learn anything said or written down, the leaders of Earth choose four people to be Wallfacers, given (at least in theory) nearly unlimited political power to develop their own plans to confront the enemy without having to defend or even share their plans with anyone.Meanwhile Mike Evans, a leader in the traitorous Earth-Trisolaris Organization discovers that the aliens have little understanding of lies and deceit since their brains display their thoughts so that "to say" and "to think" are synonyms (something that probably should have been brought up in the first book).When Luo Ji, Earth's first cosmic sociologist, is chosen as a Wallfacer, his immediate reaction is to refuse. Naturally, everyone assumes this is part of his secret plan. Taking advantage of his status, he demands a secluded estate, expensive bottles of wine, and a romantic partner resembling his dream girl. But gradually the reader learns that the Trisolarans are afraid of Luo Ji and have ordered their supporters to kill him. Shi Qiang, the police detective from the first book, also has a major role here as Luo Ji's bodyguard and confidant.The other Wallfacers seem to pursue plans involving increasing human intelligence, using nuclear bombs, and a new space fleet. In response the Trisolarans' human partners name their own Wallbreakers who will uncover and make public the true plans of the Wallfacers. Much of the book's plot comes from this conflict and the making and exposing these plans.In addition to Luo Ji, the other major character is Zhang Beihai, a political commissar in the Space Force. Early in the book he warns of defeatism and forces the resignation of the Space Force's head (no American novel would give a loyalty/morale officer this much power). He plays a major role in the expansion of the Space Fleet and then in future (after hibernating himself) becomes an acting captain (relying orders from the actual captain) when military fears its troops have been secretly imprinted with Defeatism.Both main characters hibernate, waking up 200 years later in a more advanced society with an inexhaustible supply of energy. Most people live underground, with an artificial sun. Instead of countries, there are three independent space fleets. But computer technology has not advanced much Cixin Liu's descriptions do not seem like those of a civilization as far from ours, as we are from 1815 (despite the flying cars). This is in part explained by the Great Ravine, when civilization almost collapsed due to fears about the invasion.Usually, the middle book in the trilogy takes one of two paths. Either it tries to delay the final confrontation, introducing new subplots or focusing on building up the hero to be prepared for the climatic battle, or it shows the hero near defeat and the failure of all the plans made in the first book. The Dark Forest seems to take the second route, with perhaps the most unevenly matched space battle in science fiction, only to present a surprising twist near the end. In fact, the reader may well wonder what is left for the third book. Fortunately, the third book, Death's End, translated by Ken Liu (the translator of the first book) will come out in April 2016.Considering how much attention this series has received in China and the fact that The Three-Body Problem won the best novel Hugo last year, I expect The Dark Forest will appear on the Hugo ballots again this year.
第469条评论: excellent
第470条评论: Perfect work
第471条评论: Author Liu Cixin follows up his first novel, ‘The Three Body Problem’ with another, just as good. Most of the characters from the first novel are dead, except the rude policeman Da Shi. The novel covers two hundred years after the announcement of the coming alien invasion from Proxima Centauri star system.The novel begins with the four Wallfacers, people chosen to fight the aliens and who are given dictatorial power and resources. The aliens monitor all earth communication and technology development and thwart any progress in physics through directly affecting particle accelerator output. The Wallfacers, keeping their thoughts and plans to themselves, can surprise the aliens.But that’s just the beginning. Multiple characters leap forward in time through hibernation to two hundred years later. The Wallfacers emerge with no fame or power. Their whole effort has been superseded with spectacular technical advancements. The Earth has built a fleet of two thousand ships, all faster than the invaders’ ships and armed with gamma ray lasers and fusion bombs.But everything is not as it seems. The fleet advances to intercept an alien probe sent on ahead.That’s when the action really begins.You must read this book. It has more twists than the first one.
第472条评论: Excellent story, had me hooked from start to finish. Made me look at the stars in a new and scary way.
第473条评论: This book was a bit difficult to get into. I stopped reading it multiple times before I finally started to fully enjoy and appreciate it. It is excellent, but you will need to be patient.
第474条评论: In volume two of the The Three-Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu sets out the central theme of the novel in which Earth of two hundreds in the future has prepared for the arrival of the Trisolaran invasion fleet, still two hundred years in the future. This occurs at the very beginning of the novel in a conversation between Ye Wenjie (who sent the message revealing Earth to the Trisolarans) and Luo Ji (a young astronomer of little ambition), when she suggests he found a new field of study he might call cosmic sociology. When Luo asks for the axioms of such a science, she relies:“‘First: Survival is the primary need of civilization. Second: Civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in the universe remains constant.’”Not to spoil the novel for you but to help you follow along with an understanding of why and how Luo becomes critical to thwarting the technologically superior Trisolarans and why they fear him above all Earth opponents, you should keep the above two ideas in mind even as Cixin razzle-dazzles you with technology and observations on human nature. (And you also might want to roll them around in your mind in relation to real life efforts to reach out to other beings in the universe.)In brief then, aware of the approach of the Trisolaran fleet, due in four hundred years, and of the presence of sophons, AI launched by Trisolaris to prevent Earth from pursuing quantum physics and, thus, preserving their advantage during the long flight of the fleet, Earth starts the Wallfacer project. Four scientists with practical world experience are chosen to each devise a plan to defeat the Trisolarans. They will keep their plans to themselves individually, while engaging in acts of misdirection outwardly to fool the Trisolaran sophons. Each plan is different and unique but only one plan ultimately works. Luo spends his time in a paradise location with the woman of his dreams and a child she bears for him, but does manage to launch his scheme built around the central idea mentioned above.Fast forward two hundred years, where some of the characters, among them Luo, reappear thanks to hibernation technology. They see and are amazed at how Earth has progressed both on the planet and in space. To them, Earth is a fantastical world living mostly below the surface and benefiting from phenomenal technology. In space, Earth has amassed an enormous fleet of gigantic spaceships, and everybody lives with the idea they will defeat Trisolaris. All except Zhang Beihai, a Space Force officer who hibernated with the fear defeatism might infect the fleet of the future. When he wakes, he discovers the opposite and takes action to preserve human civilization when a Trisolaran probe confronts the confident but ill prepared Earth fleet. Amid the devastation that follows, both physical and psychological, Earth, thanks to Luo, halts the Trisolaran effort, and volume two ends on a hopeful note.As with the first volume, The Three-Body Problem, Cixin dazzles readers with his grasp of both hard science and human psychology, as well his grounding in Chinese culture. It all makes for a fascinating experience for readers, and provides more spectacular action, especially in the second half of the novel.
第475条评论: Sequels are usually difficult to make even better but Cixin has succeeded in transforming the story into something even more real.
第476条评论: This series is amazing!!!! Can’t wait to start the 3rd one
第477条评论: There was a lot of hype involving this trilogy; this hype was not totally undeserved. Cixin Liu stands shoulder to shoulder with Neal Stephenson, Greg Bear, and Stephen Baxter. The ideas are captivating and the characters are engrossing.If you are into hard science fiction, you will not be disappointed; if you are reading it for a book club, you probably won't enjoy it.
第478条评论: As with the first book, the plot, and the science, are incredibly detailed and inventive. Again, though, as with the first book, the characters are a little "flat"...they just don't speak or talk to others how real people would (this might be an effect of the translation or just the style of how books are written in China...I'm not sure). Anyway, still a great read.
第479条评论: Supremely intellectual, deeply philosophical, gripping story- telling and more...this book series has everything great science fiction works should have.  Every devout fan of sci-fi should read it!
第480条评论: Its a long book, but if you keep on going it turns out to be a great read. The author is in it for the long haul and his visions of future life with an enemy on its way for centuries and what it does to society is very intriguing. And of course, the title is finally explained, a sobering thought.
第481条评论: Author does the english equivalent of naming 2 characters Rationality and Compassion. Thank god the translators didn't go for the literal interpretation, this would've been impossible to read. I wish either character engaged in behavior beyond personifying their respective namesakes.
第482条评论: It got a little complicated, but I liked it and have already pre-ordered the 3rd book in the trilogy.
第483条评论: Even better than book one. Very well written with some amazing ideas about humanity's place in the universe. Must read.
第484条评论: great book！read the origional, and finally got the english version
第485条评论: Even better than the first installment of the trilogy. Amazing plot turns, mind blowing story.
第486条评论: The best sci fi I have read in a while.  It conveys desperation almost as well as The Spin..  But with unique sociological underpinnings both human and cosmological.
第487条评论: It's a tough read ,because you must read the first of the Trilogy  .The 3 Body Problem  .Then it slowly unfolds .Incredible story , however.
第488条评论: I am amazed. All I can say is that if you like your science fiction with a dose of genius then this is for you.
第489条评论: The most astonishing book I've read since Wool. I will tell many people about this. There's so much to think about.
第490条评论: A sequel to the Three Body Problem.  Continues the story line in a well paced  tale.
第491条评论: A great sequel.
第492条评论: We ow
第493条评论: loved it!  favorite new author.  Fascinating glimpse into Chinese culture.  I've already read everything by Cixin Liu that's been translated.  Highly recommend.
第494条评论: I use audible,  this story was hard to follow. So much description would lose me, somewhat to technical. Some of it may be lost in translation as it was written by someone from China, i understand Chinese is a hard language to translate.
第495条评论: Fantastic. I think it's even better than the first one of the trilogy.
第496条评论: Great read!  Better than the first book, makes me look forward to reading the third book
第497条评论: At least as good as the first in the series. Read them both. They're different. Full of fabulous science and a fascinating take on the Fermi Paradox.
第498条评论: The book has wonderful concepts, but lacks enough energy and suspense.  We learn that life in the universe requires ruthlessness but can allow for love.
第499条评论: The best sci-fic I have ever read. Cannot stop reading it. Recommended it to my son, and he loves it too.
第500条评论: Fantastic book- even better than the first book in the series "The Three Body Problem". This sci-fi epic is gripping and imaginative and I highly recommend it!
第501条评论: Wonderful concepts and a very intriguing plot.  Takes scifi in interesting new directions.  The concept of cosmic sociology is one to think about.
第502条评论: The prose seems to struggle here and there, perhaps because of the translation or deeper cultural differences between me and the author but that never stops this being the most original and deeply engrossing tale I've read in a long time.
第503条评论: Some of the best Sci Fi I've read. I haven't read fiction in years but I couldn't resist this trilogy. So glad I read it, very mind bending and original
第504条评论: There’s little I can write that doesn’t spoil he unfolding of thus story but suffice to say that this has surpassed any of the ideas that percolated in my brain after reading The Three Body Problem.  I can’t recommend this trilogy enough.
第505条评论: This whole series is excellent and I just couldn't predict which way it was heading really at any point. I really enjoyed the sci-fi from a Chinese perspective, and it is a top class translation as it hasn't been homogenised into a . I cannot recommend this highly enough. The whole series has given me a whole month of excellent reading pleasure. And now Cixin Liu is one of my must read authors.
第506条评论: I am really glad I read this book and the one that came before (The Three Body Problem).  I don't want to say anything about the story.  If you like sci-fi, then you'll like this book.I really enjoyed that this story is anchored in Chinese culture, because most of my experience with sci-fi has been American or European.  It's cool to experience a different perspective, which is a strength of sci-fi in the first place.
第507条评论: What can I say, this is an awesome series. It might be true that the first book engaged me more (hence the 4 stars), but that doesn't take away from the series at all. I will be waiting for the third book so much! This is some real good stuff.
第508条评论: Wow, this is a roller coaster were the author is taking you high and low through his mind, changing pace all the time and nicely hidding his agenda - in plain sight. This story is so dense and full of science, science-ish thoughts, philosophy, psychology and sociology - it is an absolute pleasure to read.
第509条评论: The second book is better than the first book in the series. Many of the plot devices appear with only slender threads tying them to previous events but there is enough original creativity to keep your interest. What I find most interesting is that the main idea of the book revolves around a simple formulation of the prisoner's dilemma, only in this case it is two civilizations discovering each other's existence.
第510条评论: Book 2 moves much quicker while delving into both hats science and social science concepts. This is a great read if you like to chew on deeper what ifs. This series is also an excellent departure from the very Euro-centric fare that populates much of SF in English.
第511条评论: Liu manages to tie-in many underlying sub plots in a way that keeps your sense of morality thinking long after reading.
第512条评论: Oh The Dark Forest ... the single most frightening  explanation of the Fermi Paradox which wrecked me for days after reading. Bravo, Cixin Liu!
第513条评论: This is a very interesting book and it'll make you think. i would definitely recommend this to anyone and the audible version is very good
第514条评论: This is a great sci-fi story.  The length and the translation make it slow reading, but it pays off in the end.
第515条评论: A very interesting book! best science fiction book I have ever read! Love it
第516条评论: The writer is very knowledgable on many subjects and cultures.
第517条评论: Love the book and other science fictions written by Cixin Liu
第518条评论: Seldom does an author manage to pay out such mind blowing images & outrageous but plausible premise, then fit everything together perfectly.
第519条评论: I did try to read this after the first book, which was dreadfully written. I thought it was remotely possible it was a translation issue. Unfortunately even with a different translator the books are brutally amateurish. Even if one thought the concept was interesting (there is potential) the staggeringly poor diction and character development, not to mention the continuity issues, are impossible to overcome. I don’t even what these books playing on the same shelf with my other books.
第520条评论: A great set of stories and sub-plots help the development of this great story about humankind striving for survival. Cixin Liu masters both the description of feelings and sociological analysis, and he does it writing so exquisitely...
第521条评论: I immediately dove into book 3 of the trilogy after reading this book.
第522条评论: A+
第523条评论: Must read
第524条评论: It's been amazing for the writer to build such a powerful and tenable Dark Forest Theory!
第525条评论: Great sci fi
第526条评论: Great book. I'm very much looking forward the last book of the trilogy.
第527条评论: Solid follow up, almost through it. Really has be looking forward to the third part!
第528条评论: Great follow up to the 3 Body Problem.
第529条评论: Great SF trilogy.
第530条评论: Great sequel. Especially for Asimov Foundation fans
第531条评论: Second part of the trilogy. Nice novel.
第532条评论: The best one of the series. It should be among the greatest hard SF novels in the history. Definitely worth reading.
第533条评论: Wish he wrote better women (or even better men who treated women like people), but in terms of epic sci-fi, A+.
第534条评论: The author, while spinning an exquisite tale, is putting science back into science-fiction.  I look forward to future installments from the author.
第535条评论: One of the best books I have ever read. The writer has an incredible imagination, knowledge, and perception. Highly recommend.
第536条评论: I enjoyed the premise. However it was overlong. No need to read the third installment
第537条评论: Translation is not as good as the first book (by Ken Liu). But I love the story of this book.
第538条评论: Absolutely fabulous! An incredible imaginary and skillful novel. Better than volume one. Translation is top-notch.  .
第539条评论: Along with it's predecessor one of most imaginative, fresh and very smart books I've read in years.
第540条评论: Simply the best. Even better than the prequel. Pace is slow at the beginning, but you will be fully rewarded by your patience later.
第541条评论: Great second book to "The Three Body Problem". This is better than the first, better translation as well.
第542条评论: Fantastic sequel to a groundbreaking series. If you enjoyed the first book, you’ll love this one too. Has a bit of a slow start as you adjust to the new characters, but the novel is just as thrilling if not more so than it’s predecessor.
第543条评论: Every moment of story line is considered in depth and with focus. Each character is treated as a full human, complex yet simple and allowed to change. These books in the trilogy are to be read, not passively but with attentiveness. Great read!
第544条评论: A very good discussion of the dark forest explanation of Fermi’s paradox, and an amazing story, full of suspense. This is Sciense Fiction as good as it gets. Liu Cixin, I salute you.
第545条评论: Excellent story, though it gets little lengthy to reach events that really matters. I couldn't stop reading when I reach the last third part of the book. So far it's one of my favorite sci-fi trilogy.
第546条评论: I read all three of the Three Body Problem series.  If you like real science fiction, you will love all of these books.  The premise of The Dark Forest is very scary and very probable. I loved it!
第547条评论: This series is incredible!  It is certainly up there with some of the all time greats in terms of book series.
第548条评论: If you read The Three Body Problem, then there is no question you will be reading this book. You most certainly will not be disappointed. Liu lays out a brilliant sequence of scenarios following humankind's preparation for the arrival for the Trisolarian fleet. The imagery is mind expanding, and the technical aspect of his writing is truly fascinating. Life at its most brutal and fragile are elegantly displayed. I'm grateful for this continuing masterpiece.
第549条评论: Quite fascinating to read a SF book written by a Chinese author. The references to the recent history of China adds an exotic atmosphere. Also the plot is quite interesting.
第550条评论: It is a bit slow in the middle and reader wonders why whole arc of story that involves destruction of Earth' space fleet was needed. But the ending saves the book.
第551条评论: Science fiction is truly a global form of communication. This writer proves this truth. I have only read this trilogy but I look forward to reading more by this author.
第552条评论: In my humble opinion, this is the best second book of a trilogy, since "A Tale of Two Towers".  Is it possible that we have found the Dostoevsk  of science fiction?
第553条评论: The future world based on real science was so real, it made feel it could really happen. Totally awesome!!! Thanks!
第554条评论: Continues the narrative well. Interesting characters, and progression that was not predictable. Looking forward to the last book in the trilogy.
第555条评论: Another excellent book by Liu Cixin. Different scope than The Three Body Problem, but quite as good. Can't wait for the third in the series.
第556条评论: This is a really great end to an awesome series.I really hope more of this author's books get translated.
第557条评论: Not as great as The Three Body Problem, but still one of the best sci-fi books I have read, packed full of awesome, well-thought-through ideas.
第558条评论: Fans of The Three Body Problem won't be disappointed in the second installment of the series. Another breath of fresh air into the science fiction genre.
第559条评论: This book explored the social repercussions of the conflicts introduced in Three Body while continuing the author's clever style of writing.
第560条评论: I had trouble sleeping because I wanted to finish this book! And what a finish...
第561条评论: It truly is one of the few books in the past year that has truly changed how I look at the universe
第562条评论: No where near as good as the first book. Without giving away too much, there are some seriously unbelievable decisions made by characters, devoid of reasonable motivation, that make absolutely no sense. I can suspend disbelief to enjoy most science fiction, but after the third or fourth asinine character decision, I actually had to put the book down. A quick check of the plot on wikipedia confirmed my suspicion that the author got lost in his own convoluted story and couldn't write his way out sensibly. I have no idea how some people are rating this five stars.
第563条评论: Loved this creative tale of near extinction and redemption. The cultural lessons give it an added burst of flavor.  Great.
第564条评论: This is a great series, now waiting for #3. This one does keep you right up till the end.
第565条评论: The Dark Forest was even better than Three Body Problem. This book like the first book makes you think!
第566条评论: This is hard science fiction at its finest. Great characters, vision and plotting. I am eagerly waiting on the third installment.
第567条评论: Wasn't sure how the "The Three-Body Problem" could be topped but this book is even better.
第568条评论: Really makes you think about big questions.  Sci-Fi at it's best.
第569条评论: Colin
第570条评论: The universe is a dark forest.  I cried in a bar when I finished this book.
第571条评论: Ultimately satisfying but there's a lot of tedious discussion between characters about the right way to approach organizational matters and societal goals.
第572条评论: Great book tons of great ideas. Fresh perspective. A little slow at times, sometimes a little melodramatic, but well worth the wait.
第573条评论: I can't wait for the final installment to be translated. This is a thinking person's science fiction series, almost to the level of the Dune series.
第574条评论: Fascinating, but not for all palates
第575条评论: The author has the ability to build plots within plots and its hard to see in advance what’s coming.The personage is most fascinating.
第576条评论: I should have omitted the first 300 pages then it would have been worthy. Such a long and arduous development process for an interesting final twist
第577条评论: Outstanding novel from China's leading author of science fiction.  Extremely well-conceived and executed.  Truly an engrossing read.  Highly recommended.
第578条评论: The first book, The Three Body Problem, was truly one of the finest hard scifi stories I've read, and this is a worthy continuation. Can't wait for the finale!
第579条评论: Uzun yıllar sonra bilim kurgudan yeniden zevk almamı sağlayan roman serisi... Meraklısına tavsiye ederim... Keşke Türkçeye de çevrilse, daha çok insana ulaşsa...
第580条评论: A worthy sequel to The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth's Past)
第581条评论:  - beautifully written, masterfully translated, and well worth your time.
第582条评论: Great story and even better science....
第583条评论: The Dark Forest is the second book of the trilogy. What makes it awesome is not only the plot of wallfacers, after all each wallfacer's plan could be the ultimate resolution for the crisis in other similar books, but also a insightful and concise cosmic sociology. I will recommend the book to friends, really fantastic!
第584条评论: Dull in the first half, but picks up and becomes quite exciting in the second half.
第585条评论: Wow!  I have not been much of a science fiction reader since I was young, but this series may get me back into the genre. Particularly appreciated the Asian perspective
第586条评论: Typical bridge in a trilogy. A little slow in the middle but finished well.
第587条评论: A sci-fi worth many others! Beautifully written and skillfully crafted. No word is wasted. The slow progression and at times seemingly oversold backgrounds are connected masterfully by the end.
第588条评论: Excellent! A bright novel that touch the difficult topic about alien civilization contacts and interactions, can I say that this author goes a step forward from what the golden age of science fiction from Isaac Asimov stablished.
第589条评论: Great book that I want to talk about but can't because spoilers. I love the proposed solution to the Fermi paradox, and the war is so unique that I couldn't stop reading.
第590条评论: I liked this book a little better than the first. Very intelligent writing and an excellent sci-fi story. I'm not going to comment on the plot. Just highly recommend the first 2 books. Eager to start reading the final one.
第591条评论: Up to his usual excellent standards. What an interesting mind!
第592条评论: Although long and occasionally over elaborated, the author's perceptions of earth's place in the larger universe is creative and expansive. I look forward to the third volume.
第593条评论: This book basically reveals a realistic theory to the Fermi paradox and drake equations..  It's absolutely stunning with twists and turns that will shock the reader every time. One of the best books that I have ever read.
第594条评论: Something for every Science Fiction fan.  Alternate realities, imagine, complex civilizations, fascinating characters and best of all an optimistic future.  A small glimpse of the Chinese culture for an American.
第595条评论: Thoughtful with unexpected turns
第596条评论: First SF book in a long while.  Good story, good characters, and the pace kept accelerating . I’m starting the 3rd book now!
第597条评论: The subject says it all...Can't wait to read number three.  I liked the second book better than the first.
第598条评论: This is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read. It is right up there with the first book.
第599条评论: The second book of the trilogy outpaces the first in all areas. It's plot grows organically and draws you near with every chapter. What side of the wall will you choose?
第600条评论: Real old fashioned science fiction. Good plot. Characters are rather flat - none of them felt like believable people to me. Nevertheless it was a good read.
第601条评论: Not only great sci fi, but just a great book! I really love the way the author deals with both the future of science and the truths of societies.
第602条评论: Not sure what happened to the second book, but it was absolutely agonising to read the pitiful descriptions of the women (when they actually surfaced in the book) in this book. I was literally tapping through my kindle to get to the end of the plot, so my brain could stop hurting whenever they described women as either just slim flowery props or completely unnamed powerless side shows. In describing his "dream woman" (who may as well be a blow-up doll", the main character asserts that "She’s knowledgeable, but not to the point where it calcifies her. It only makes her more sensitive to life and to the world." Then, there's the Secretary General of the UN who is described as a “refined Asian lady who didn’t project the sense of power needed”. Woe is the feminine form who either can't be too smart, too robust or too powerful.
第603条评论: "The Dark Forest" in an intricately plotted sequel to Cixin Liu's "Three Body Problem". I confess, having read "Three Body",  I purchased "Dark Forest" on faith that it would be a satisfying read. Indeed it was, despite having no clue what the title "The Dark Forest" meant about the story. Readers will have to read throught to the very end of this second novel in a series to get the answer to that question as the first interstellar probe arrives in the Solar System from Trisolaris.The plot concerns itself with the humanity's creation of the Wallfacer Project which embodies 4 persons selected to guide humanity's strategy to confront the danger of the invading interstellar civilation. The intent is to hide that strategy, in the mionds of the Wallfacers,  from the intelligence gathering Sophons which have been seeded on Earth to monitor humanity's every action. The Sophons also successfully block all technological progress that humanity might achieve to fight the invasion.Character's from the first novel, Luo Shi and Da Shi, are main characters that continue to be involve in humanity's fate because they have hibernated into the future.Despite the Wallfacer project and attempts at defense, humanity's fate hangs in in the balance until the very end of the novel when the stage is set for the soon to be published third and concluding novel.I cannot wait.
第604条评论: I enjoyed this a great deal more than the first book. Although, as in the Three Body Problem, there were some details that were a total reach, never once did it detract from its true narrative mission. Worthy successor to Asimov’s legacy without doubt.
第605条评论: I liked this book.  It was a little longer than it needed to be but I like the way it ended.  Don't know how the third book is going to start and I hope it's just not t r going to squeeze more out of a story that could end with this book.
第606条评论: I loved "Three Body Problem" for its distinctive mix of Chinese political history, personal narrative, fantastical imagination, and ingenious hard-SF imagining of a SETI first contact. Some of the nuts-and-bolts logic of the plot didn't quite make sense, but in the context of the sheer genius of the book such nitpicks hardly mattered. Most of the same enjoyable elements are back in book two, The Dark Forest, but the narrative is weaker and the logical holes are so glaring this time that they really stopped me in my tracks.I won't engage in any plot spoilers here, but I can broadly tick off some of the things that gnawed away at me. Key plot points reveal that Cixin Liu has no idea how the Hubble Space Telescope works. No idea how astronomers study planets around other stars. No idea how an atomic bomb works. No idea how a gun works! The errors are so glaring that at first I took them for translation glitches, but as the plot progresses it's clear that they are the author's own mistakes--mistakes that a half hour of googling could have avoided. For me, that laziness eroded a lot of the suspension of disbelief needed to soar through a book like this.There are also several pivotal moments in the middle section when primary characters (most notably the Wallfacers and Wallbreakers) behave in illogical ways that seem entirely out of character, and counter to human nature. That's a subjective reaction on my part, I realize. Many others clearly felt otherwise.What troubled me the most, though, was the whole concept of "the dark forest." Again, I don't want to engage in any plot spoilers here. Suffice it to say, if you know anything about astronomy and SETI efforts, you'll understand that the premise is wildly, laughably misguided. It relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of how scientists locate sources in the sky. The plot could have worked much the same with a more realistic depiction of the dark-forest concept, but the way it's explained here is techno-babble of the lowest order.All of which is a shame, because many of the characters are beautifully drawn, the plotting is again blazingly creative, and some of the insights into mass psychology are sensitive and surprising. There's so much to love about this book. I just wish the good didn't come weighted with such a lodestone of simplistic goofs.
第607条评论: The story has potentials to become a sci-fi masterpiece of all time but the development of main characters is a little weak. However, the scope of the plot and those creative concepts presented in this book really out-shadowed other elements. It’s very interesting the story line can be both ridiculous and convincing at the same time. It’s not only thought-provoking but also make you challenge your beliefs.
第608条评论: I read 100+ books per year, so I don't suffer even mediocre books before I call them quits. Also, I am not a particularly big fan of the science fiction genre. I read these three books after coming across so many recommendations for the series. The Three-Body Problem Series is OUTSTANDING! Each book in the series is better than its predecessor.
第609条评论: I thought the first book of the series was mind-bending and mesmerizingly horrifying. I even felt that the Three Body Problem was almost on par with the original Foundation trilogy. Coming from that, I had huge expectations for the Dark Forest. And what a dissappointing letdown it was. While I'd like to think that the translation may've played a part in how certain dialogues and thoughts were portrayed, many of the character developments and plots made no sense whatsoever. Almost like the author expected his readers to be empty vessels with little grasp of reality or common sense. A few things that painfully stood out for me:- While the concept of the droplet was fascinating and the whole battle with it was terrifying, the author's reasoning behind the battle (as it transpired) was just plain stupid. Who, in their right minds, would send Earth's entire fleet to observe a probe? The plot device used by the author to explain why the entire fleet was sent to the other end of the solar system to intercept the probe is just laughable. Forget military strategy. Even from a basic common sense and risk mitigation standpoint, the plot point was ridiculous and insulting to me. It's akin to saying that the US or China or Russia would send their nation's entire naval fleet to intercept one tiny reconnaissance vessel from a rival nation thus leaving the whole nation vulnerable to other attacks.- The mental conversation that takes place between the officers aboard the Natural Selection is confusing. I can see that the author was probably influenced by Asimov's Foundation (specifically, the Second Foundation) but, in this context, it made no sense whatsoever.  Up until that point, there had been no clear references to complex non-verbal communications between humans. And, then, all of a sudden, officers aboard this rogue vessel have developed this ability to communicate complex thoughts non-verbally. I just don't get it.- Finally, Luo Ji's character is bizarre and worrying. At times, the author tries to poetically describe Luo Ji's inner thoughts and motivations. However, to me, it just ends up taking away from the overall narrative and, in a way, even works against the narrative. Based on the author's description of Luo Ji's escapades with his imaginary girlfriend, it's quite possible that Luo Ji might be showing schizophrenic tendencies; in addition, they never clearly describe exactly why he was chosen as a Wallfacer. A more interesting plot point would've been if Luo Ji had hidden his true Wallfacer plans within the stories playing out in his mind. Sadly, this doesn't seem to have been the case as the author doesn't really get into the character's head in any meaningful way besides painting him as a person with potentially serious emotional and mental issues.Overall, the book was an average read. I would say that at least about 100 pages can be shaved off the page count. Coming from the high of the Three Body Problem, this was a very perplexing read. I really hope Death's End does a much better job with character development, narrative framing, and just plain logic.
第610条评论: This author has a knack for keeping you reading and invested for almost 500 pages before smacking you with some mind-bending twists and conclusions. I was not as invested in this one as the first book in the series because, like the Wallfacer project, you are shrouded from understanding what the plan or plot is. In many ways, he wrote this novel to make you understand the Trisolaris’ inability to read human thoughts and remain ignorant to the strategic nature of the story. Well done
第611条评论: Not quite as good as "The Three Body Problem", but still excellent, and necessary for anyone after reading the first novel. (The first novel should definitely be read first.)
第612条评论: The Drake equation tells us that even if we're pessimistic about the chances of life in our galaxy, that their should be someone like us, and on our technical level at some point. The Fermi paradox says, if so, why can't we find them after all this time we've spent looking?The concept presented by the book of the 'Dark Forest' is one of the most terrifying possible answer to the Fermi paradox. It's an important idea presented in a fictional form. This is the most interesting and compelling book in the trilogy, and can leave you haunted.
第613条评论: The Dark Forest is the second book in the Three Body Problem Trilogy by Cixin Liu. The first book was a great read and I enjoyed it a lot, but this book is probably the best science fiction I've ever read. Cixin Liu is a genius, he probably started a new field of study with this book. I usually spend a fair amount of time thinking about a book after I've finished reading it, but after 4 months of reading this book, I'm still thinking about the philosophical arguments . A must read for anyone interested in science fiction and philosophy.
第614条评论: Took me a while to want to read it as I'd paid too much attention to the negative reviews. If you like Dan Simmons's Hyperion series, Clarke's Rama series and even the original Dune series ending in Chapterhouse, then this can safely join that shelf of reads. Cannot compare each with the other as they arise from different thoughts but this was a most enjoyable read. For those who ridiculed the supposed lack of character development,  what were they reading? (And I'm not even one for character development in science fiction and yet the book gives it, if it's important to you).
第615条评论: Picks up speed in 2nd half
第616条评论: A solid sequel
第617条评论: The quality and complexity in science fiction writing is unparalleled, even as compared to the first in the series (Third-Body Trilogy, translated from Chinese). The plot is way too complicated to cover quickly, but story combines complex characters, peril, mystery, and technology in the most fascinating ways (think Expanse or Red Rising but way more technical). I cannot wait to read the third in the series and only hope it can stand up to this one.
第618条评论: This is the best book of the trilogy.I just finished the Chinese version of all three books. I am only getting the English version of book 2.Book 1 is an excellent start which describes the other civilization. It is certainly a fun read. Book 3 describes a pretty dark universal rule for the universe. Although all three books are full of twists and suspense, Book 1 and 3 have obvious holes in the plot and concept. They are more into conceptual development than character and story development.Book 2 is weak on character development too, as many others have described. However, the scenario is much more realistic: what humanity will do when facing elimination. The scientific context is no longer important. The same story will happen whether facing alien invasion or some other disasters. That's what made this book apart from the other two.Four wallfacers are appointed with responsibilities to develop their own strategies against the impending invasion, and depending on their background and past experience, they use all their might, imagination, and knowledge to create what they thought as the best way for the human race. There is a lot of twist and turns and surprises.The plot of one wallfacer is different in the English version. That's another reason why I am buying this book in English instead of the other two. However, I would buy it even there is no difference.
第619条评论: After reading Three Body Problem and absolutely LOVING it, I was worried that the second book would not do it justice.  I was immediately proven wrong as I was thoroughly engaged, immersed in the world of the The Dark Forest.  Cixin Liu, already a master in my mind after reading Three Body Problem, cemented his place among the top authors in my mind with the second book of the trilogy.  This is hard sci-fi at its best.  Inspiring and imaginative, this is the type of novel to make you think; the kind of book that makes you better and smarter for having read it.  That is not to say you will be smarter because it has conveyed some secret knowledge, but it opens your mind to considering things you never considered, and it opens up your imagination to things you may never have considered.  This is really fantastic literature and anyone on the fence should jump head first into it.
第620条评论: Disclaimer: this review refers specifically to the audible version.The first book was great! Interesting concept portrayed through a gripping setting (mid-20th century China, cultural revolution period) and decent narration. This one is a complete let down. It may be due to bad translation or the worst vocal reading I’ve ever heard. But imagine kindergarten level dialogue, vocally expressed by an inferior Siri, infected with a boring computerized male voice.I may decide to cheat and google the outcome of this series based on, “the dark forrest’s,” production value. It was extremely tough to make it through this narration. One star is too much! Again, translation & narration are main CONs. However, due to the previously mentioned negatives, I can’t tell if the story & writing have not fallen far from the initial book.
第621条评论: Ugh. This took me THREE WEEKS to read.THREE WEEKS.I don’t take three weeks to read anything. And now I feel drained of the energy to start anything else.This book is VERY dense. Fans of hard science fiction will love it. I understood almost nothing. There are pages upon pages of scientific descriptions. Fusion engine space ships, neutrons, sophons, radio transmissions, hydrogen bombs, oil film mining, the list goes on.I could have dealt with all that, but I felt like the story was lost along the way. The characters were utterly forgettable. I couldn’t keep half of them straight. Zhang Behai and Luo Ji and Shi Qang were the only ones. There were entire story lines revolving around characters I couldn’t recall so I had no idea what was going on for those moments.There are some parts of the story that swept me away. It was slow to get going and then when it got started it seemed like it was stopped immediately. That really severely hindered the pace and had an adverse affect on my enjoyment. For most of this book I truly thought it would be a two star read.The formatting was God awful. The book is divided into three parts and there are NO chapter breaks. This gave an already dense book an even denser feeling. I needed a convenient place to stop. I wanted to be cut a break. Instead, every time I put down the book I dreaded picking it back up because I knew I’d be left with this feeling of needing to continue on but not wanting to.I gave it an extra star because part 3 was really good overall and the ending was excellent. I will probably continue with the series even though this was a disappointing entry. I’m hoping that a return to Ken Liu as the translator will make the third book more enjoyable.
第622条评论: Cixin Liu's first book in this series "The Three Body Problem" blew me away with its original story and unique style. The second book "The Dark Forest" looked to be all gloom-and-doom with a depressing cliff-hanger up until the final chapter - what a surprise and creative ending! Liu's ideas are totally refreshing among current SciFi literature and well worth your time.

第627条评论: ‘The Dark Forest’ is the second volume in Cixin Liu’ trilogy, Remembrance of Earth’s Past. This book picks up where the first volume ended. The Trisolarans had thrown the gauntlet, calling the human race ‘bugs’. They had put sophons in place to impair our progress in technology and science. This would limit the growth of the human race until the invaders could get here and take the planet from us. The second volume has the humans trying to figure out a way to stop the Trisolarans or come up with a defense that win the impending war. Should we defend the Earth and fight the invaders? Should we leave the Earth and escape the coming war?These are the questions that the humans are facing. The humans select four people to come up with  their own plan on how to deal with this problem. As these ‘Wallfacers’ works, they must keep the plans secret as the group of humans (the ETO) are still working with the Trisolarans. Which plan will work? The clock is ticking…while 400 years seems like a long time to hatch a plan, it goes by quickly.There are some characters in the first volume who carry over to the book. The police officer Da Shi becomes a large part of this book. How the ‘Wallfacers’ develop their plans is great. So well thought out and developed. It all leads us to ‘The Dark Forest’, which was a great concept to read through. I am looking forward to the final volume. How will this story end?
第628条评论: One of the worst sci-fi novels I've ever read. Infused with a soul-less Communist cynicism the narrative arc is gibberish pretending to be cool. A lot of dupes (I'm talking to you, Mr. Uplift) taken in.
第629条评论: Cixin Liu’s “The Dark Forest” is the second novel in his “Remembrance of Earth’s Past” trilogy, picking up shortly after the events of “The Three-Body Problem,” in which the Trisolaran people have locked Earth’s technological development with sophons and launched an invasion fleet that will take 400 years to arrive. Now, the Earth prepares with various space forces developing ships and space elevators. Meanwhile, the United Nations begins the Wallfacer Project, to encourage experts to think of unpredictable ways to combat the Trisolarans. The sophon technology makes it all but impossible for humanity to hide secrets, but the Trisolarans cannot read human thoughts nor can they understand the concept of lying. To that end, the Wallfacers are empowered to travel where they want and access any resources they need, but are not required to disclose the purpose of their requests. Suspended-animation technology will also enable them to leapfrog the 400 years to doomsday, so that they can intervene at the moments where they feel they will have the greatest impact. The Earth-Trisolaris Organization, dedicated to aiding the Trisolarans and ending the human tyranny they perceive, works to counter their actions with Wallbreakers who are tasked to figure out the Wallfacers’ plans based on close analyses of their actions.Liu includes references to Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” trilogy (pg. 171-172), a series that his story resembles in its long-term examination of societal change to survive a pending disaster. In addressing the social experiments that the Wallfacers begin, Liu includes a reference to “A Clockwork Orange” (pg. 272). Further, Liu imagines a future in which the common language blends elements of English and Chinese, writing, “English, formerly the most widely used language, and Chinese, spoken by the largest population, had blended with each other to become the world’s most powerful language” (pg. 322). In this, he evokes Joss Whedon’s “Firefly” while also reflecting current linguistic trends due to the internet and film industries. Ironically, the book is even more prescient in imagining remote meetings becoming a common practice (pg. 322). The future position of the space fleets as governments in their own right recalls the International Fleet from Orson Scott Card’s “Ender’s Game” series, though Liu describes the changing geopolitics as giving rise to three fleets as superpowers with the future Earth becoming something of a socialist utopia, though he points out that the advanced technology builds upon common ideas from our own period due to the sophon block, thereby preventing the future from becoming inaccessible to the reader (pgs. 323, 338, 370). References to “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Cube” help keep the characters relatable compared to other science fiction, as they process their experiences by relating them to fiction in the same way the reader would should they find themselves in a similar position (pgs. 415, 433).For some reason, Tor Books switched translators for the American publication, with Joel Martinsen replacing Ken Liu, who translated the first and third book as well as the authorized fan-fiction spin-off, “The Redemption of Time.” As the second volume in the series, Liu can spend more time on the plot than explaining concepts as he did in the first novel, though the world-building continues, particularly in the second half of the novel where Liu jumps about 200 years forward in time. Where “Three Body Problem” and the first half of “The Dark Forest” were more high-concept science fiction set largely in our own world, the second half involves more of the tropes of sci-fi, including advanced technology and space travel, though Liu works to carefully explain how even the most advanced tech has limitations due to the sophons. Theories regarding the nature of alien civilizations run throughout “The Dark Forest,” however, with the title offering an analogy that builds upon the Fermi Paradox (pgs. 484-485).
第630条评论: This book omits the genre-bending aspects of the first novel; it's pure science fiction. And the end is a bit pat, with too many story threads resolved too quickly. But it's on the whole an intriguing and compelling page-turner of a novel. It derives most from War of the Worlds and the Foundation Trilogy, and if you like the genre you'll like this too.
第631条评论: The Trisolaris invasion fleet is on its way toward the Solar System.  It will arrive in about 400 years.  Earth is in serious danger because the invaders are well ahead of Earth's technology and they also have the technological ability to listen in on any conversation.To counter this,  Earth selected four individuals, called Wallfacers, who would devise plans to defeat the enemy.  Since the plans would remain in their minds the plans would hopefully not become known to the invasion fleet. The book mainly concerns itself with one of these Wallfacers, Luo Ji.The book is quite inventive and delights on many levels.  My only complaint is that I became acutely aware of its excessive 500 page length.
第632条评论: The Dark Forest is the sequel to the "Three Body Problem". I enjoyed it, though less than I enjoyed the three body problem, perhaps because Liu Cixin's novelty had worn off a little. The book deals with Earth's attempts to deal with the impending invasion from Trisolaris and the "impending doom" setup found strange echoes in the early days of the Trump administration (at least for me), which probably made it more interesting that it was. The middle sagged, a lot, and at times it was only the certainty that Liu has big revelations in store for the last section that kept me going. The last section did not disappoint though, with brilliant plot twists and a pretty solid ending.The characterization and human psychology are generally weak with Liu and this book seemed weaker than the first, but the little details of future technology are wonderfully dense and imaginative and the overall plot is truly cosmic in scale and well worth a read. Some of the clunkier elements in the characterization may just be a problem of "Han to Indo-European" translation, but one does get the feeling that while Liu is an extraordinarily widely read and imaginative nerd, he is definitely not a great psychologist (or mass pyschologist; the reactions of crowds and of humanity as a whole to the various events frequently seem contrived and/or unconvincing). The whole business of power and politics is also weakly imagined and unconvincing. It is not the main point, so it doesn't take much away from the book, but it is definitely not a strong point.The fact that most of the action is around Chinese characters gives the book a suitably exotic touch, though it is also interesting to see how deeply the high culture elements of the Western tradition are now part of the life and mental universe of an intelligent and well read Chinese writer (and presumably, his audience). In fact, the West itself may have fewer people familiar with all those elements than there are Chinese fans now, just because there are so many Chinese people!In short, there are a lot of interesting little details that will get you thinking on tangents about cultural anthropology and what does and does not become part of world civilization.One quote that recurs in the book "Make time for civilization, for civilization won't make time" is noted by other reviewers as a possible mild mis-translation. I am still not sure what it is supposed to mean. And yes, the laws of cosmic sociology are open to debate, but that is Liu's take on the Fermi paradox and it makes for a darn good book.Overall, well worth a read. And I hear part three is better.
第633条评论: I loved the moody mystery of Three Body. While this book retains the unfortunate emotional flatness of the original, it also retains the boundless creativity and ability to deliver delightful and horrifying surprises to the reader. While it isn't without flaws, it is nonetheless a classic. My only advice is to read it now and guard yourself against spoilers.
第634条评论: If you know about "Axiom System", you would understand how great this Sci-fi novel is. It is more like an extension of an academic paper, based on several simple but solid (assumed to be) Axioms. However, academic paper is boring to the non-scientist and this novel is wonderful to read. The imagination in the book would usually strike your mind and make you wonder what just happens? The extreme strategy of desperate human, the human's group reaction to the disaster in a historical view, the playing hand of politicians and the beauty of humanity, all of these lead you to think about the universe and ourselves.I bet after reading this book, you would stare the stars again, thinking over the old question: what is there? Hopefully, the answer would be different.
第635条评论: This is a fantastic book, but I am not going to comment on the plot or character development. I start reading this English version, but soon I found this typographic problems. I checked the Chinese version and am sure those zeroes should not be there. This is just page 14, and I am not sure how many errors like this in the rest of the book.
第636条评论: Following on from 'The Three-Body Problem', the Trisolaran invasion fleet has been launched from the nearby Centaurus system and is 400 years out from Earth. Trisolaran technology appears invincible and worse, the Trisolarans can listen to everything happening on Earth *and* have a fifth column of human supporters for their genocidal mission.Liu Cixin's science fiction is old-school and high-concept, inspired equally by Isaac Asimov's psychohistory and China's ancient history. This second volume grapples with the problem: how can you deal with an extermination force of overwhelming military superiority, almost perfect data intelligence but one which is hundreds of years away, past any planning horizon politicians, the military and the people are accustomed to?As ever, the author's solutions are ingenious while in volume three, 'Death's End' (due out in April 2016), his ambitions seem to be set even higher.
第637条评论: I'm a huge sci fi fan and loved the book!
第638条评论: I don’t know why this book and this series is so good, it’s really not my typical read, but there’s something so captivating about the science and the details and humanity and what changes over centuries. Totally unique book that anyone with any interest in sci fi should be reading.
第639条评论: This story carries the same vibe and atmosphere of the previous book. I thought it was a little dry and void of interesting things in the beginning half. The last half proves to be worth the read and I found it to be beyond my expectations. I can't wait to read the final book. Great writing.
第640条评论: Probably the most cerebral (yet still accessable) book I've ever read. A fantastic sequel to an incredible first book. If I say anything I think I'd give it away. But if you want to know what our future could look like if we were driven by fear, this is a great read. If you want to see how society could change, how it would react differently, how the old becomes mythical, larger than life, whilst still being just as human as any of us, then this is the book for you.Read it. It may be some of the most rewarding reading you ever do.

第654条评论: Thank you, Liu.
第655条评论: Nice:)
第656条评论: Unique writing. Facinating!
第657条评论: Disappointed. Reminded me of the "required reading schlock" I was forced to read on the other side of the Iron Curtain years ago. Finding 5-star reviews, proclaiming this series to be some sort of second coming of sci-fi, rather strange.
第658条评论: The Three-Body Problem wasn't great, but it was good. Well-grounded in 20th century history and possessing only the requisite amount of hand-waving to support interstellar science fiction, the developments and twists stayed interesting enough to keep me reading.Unfortunately, The Dark Forest doesn't live up to its predecessor. Faster-than-light communication and supercomputers the size of protons are more believable than the irrational, bordering on insane, decision-making on display throughout this book.The Wallfacer project, Earth's attempt at keeping strategic plans a secret from omnipresent alien spies, ends with all of the non-protagonist Wallfacers' plans foiled - plans to destroy Earth's own fleet, to destroy the entire solar system, and to reprogram the minds of humanity to believe that defeat is inevitable. These are the people who are supposed to be defending humanity, to be clear. The most believable part of all of this (at least for anyone who has ever worked in government or politics) is that the world's governments, after enacting a plan which hinges on lack of explanation and accountability, immediately begin demanding explanation and accountability, as well as undermining all of the Wallfacers' efforts.The protagonist, apparently having been hallucinating a "perfect" woman, uses his position to send people to find her in the real world. This succeeds(!), and of course she falls in love with him. I'd like to take a moment to underline how absurd and unnecessary all of this was. If you decide you need to motivate your hard SF hero with a two-dimensional stereotype of a love interest, just have him fall in love in the conventional manner. There's no need for an extended, suspension-of-disbelief-snapping, non-sequitur of an aside involving anyone's imaginary girlfriend coming to life.Anyway, after having "cast a spell" on a neighboring star (an act which every other character laughs off, but which is telegraphed by the author to have been the correct course of action), we follow the protagonist ~200 years into the future via hibernation. It quickly becomes apparent that the comparative utopia that we find there and the inhabitants' unanimous optimism regarding humanity's chances against the incoming alien fleet are an elaborate setup for a bait & switch. By the time the first probe arrives and all of humanity decides (spontaneously and simultaneously) that the aliens are friendly after all because the probe is shiny (not an exaggeration), it's almost a relief when the probe destroys the entire human fleet by itself. The entire fleet of thousands of ships are all sent to intercept this completely unknown alien device because they all wanted to go (again, not an exaggeration). The probe is able to destroy everything because it is made of invincible unobtanium, and to be perfectly honest this is the point where I started to heavily skim vs reading every word. There are many, many pages where the probe is destroying more ships.Long story short, the few ships which escape destruction by the probe turn on each other, the "spell" turns out to have succeeded (the star whose location was broadcast was destroyed, ostensibly by a third, otherwise unknown civilization), and humanity attempts to use the threat of such a signal to negotiate a truce with the invaders. There's a lot more detail, but again, skimming.If this review seems overly drawn out and only marginally coherent, then I have managed to accurately convey the experience of reading The Dark Forest.
第659条评论: Fantastic, creative story!!!!!!
第660条评论: solid.
第661条评论: Great sci-fi
第662条评论: Nice plots
第663条评论: Masterpiece!
第664条评论: The second book in the series is ok at best. I’ll read the third book to find out how it ends, but my general advice to other readers would be to stop after completing the first book.
第665条评论: What a phenomenal book that captivates the imagination. An intimate epic that explores the inner world of the human mind and soul as deeply as it does the entire universe.
第666条评论: great sci-fi story and amazing story line. The dark forest theory is so brilliant that will be regarded as high as Three Laws of Robotics by Asimov
第667条评论: I liked the concept better than the execution.  The story follows that of the first book, but is very different - almost entirely new cast of characters, set much later in time, etc.  While the first novel was built around a mystery, this one sets up the stakes of the plot right away and the only mystery is how the characters will prevail.  The characters were a bit more flat and a bit less interesting than in Three Body Problem, but it's still a strong enough entry that I'll stick it out for the third book.
第668条评论: Thought provoking book with a very engaging story.
第669条评论: Liu presents a non-stop narrative that switches gears between thoughtful exposition and non-stop action. Just when you thought you had the plot in hand, Liu switches gears with surprising results! If you liked The Three Body Problem, you'll like this one too. A great sequel, fun to read, funny and profound.
第670条评论: This book presents an entirely unique view on the Fermi Paradox. It delves deep into both human and nonhuman psychology. Instead of just thinking outside the box, he exposes the inner sanctum to the outside in a vivid mix.
第671条评论: The book was on the point about human natures. Facing a health crisis, all sorts of human stupidity draw parellel with what was written in the book.
第672条评论: i read all three books in chinese in a roll. it was really good. so happy this is in english now fr more people
第673条评论: Good start, great descriptions of characters and really insightful on child rearing. Great!But... The science and ideas of the situation he describes are unbearable bad. Progress of the story is dull. Stopped reading.
第674条评论: These books  are a true reflection of Cixin Liu's writing.
第675条评论: I did not finish this book. It was not my style of writing. It had much more detail about the background lives of the characters and little progress in action and the story moving forward.
第676条评论: absolutely amazing
第677条评论: "The Three-Body Problem" got the Hugo Award?Then this book deserves a dozen...
第678条评论: A wonderful blend of hard science fiction and human irrationality in the face of extraordinary circumstances.

第690条评论: The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu is the second book in his Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy. The Three Body Problem was a huge success and it was such a blast to read through! With The Dark Forest, we get a different vibe and flow to the story then in the first but it manages to capture and hold your attention nonetheless. We obviously have to give credit to the translator of the book as without him we probably wouldn't be able to enjoy this great art of work by Cixin Liu. Although I obviously haven't read the original work in Chinese, I would say that the translator did a good job in translating the book. The tone and atmosphere matches closely to The Three Body Problem, which was translated by yet another translator. That makes it that much more impressive with what they've accomplished altogether.The previous book introduced the readers as to how Earth as a civilization got to discover Trisolaris. The inevitable invasion of the Trisolarans is now the focus of The Dark Forest and how Earth is planning on tackling the problem that won't come for another two century. How does one actually prepare for that eventuality? What, if anything, can even be done with the sophons blocking and hampering scientific discovery on Earth so that they won't be able to advance at a rapid pace to combat the invading Trisolaran fleet two centuries from the present? The Dark Forest focuses more from the humans living on Earth perspective than on the Trisolaran's themselves. I was actually quite disappointed at this because part of the allure of reading about a whole different civilization in the universe besides our's is what made The Three Body problem so mysterious and fun. We hardly get any glimpse at all to the Trisolarans here. That in some degree also can be argued that it lends to the mystique of the Trisolarans themselves but I personally would have loved for some, even if little, of the attention to have been focused on the mysterious civilization.Similar to the first, the difficulties that plague our protagonists and what drives them to make the choices they make is what makes reading this series so enjoyable. The full weight of their choices and decisions made here will have an impact on how Earth's civilization will be like decades and decades from now and so it goes without saying that there is immense pressure to get things right. While The Dark Forest initially seemed to have lost the mysticism and uniqueness when compared to the first book, I believe it made up for it towards the end with how things proceeded and whatnot. Just like the first, we do get from time to time scientific explanation of things that many of us would not have understood but these are sparse and well spaced out so that it doesn't weigh the readers down with too much technical jargon and details all at once.What it boils down to is this: if you've read The Three Body Problem, then you're most likely going to read The Dark Forest and similarly, if you've enjoyed the first then you'll find similar feelings here. What surprised me after having finished The Dark Forest is that the author didn't leave much motivation for the readers to devour book three, the final in the series, immediately afterwards. In fact, I'm actually debating if I should as I was left quite satisfied with the ending in The Dark Forest. Most of the issues were resolved and so technically the story could have ended right here. However, the main reason why I'm on the fence for the third and final book is that I'm positive the author will go into a lot more details regarding the Trisolarans. Well, at least that's what I'm hoping for personally! Either way you look at it, The Dark Forest is awesome and can be considered a must-read if you've enjoyed The Three Body Problem previously.
第691条评论: I think this book was a slog because I don't delight in a two-page description of a walk into the desert. Way too much description and sections that I found myself only reading the first sentence of a long paragraph and skimming the rest. Once you get past about page 300 (of 512), the story does pick up speed, but still too much description for my taste.The story is imaginative, in a way like nothing I've ever read. How do you stop a superior alien race from taking over your planet and wiping out humanity, even if you have 400 years to prepare, when said alien have planted "sophons" interdimensional listening devices that transmit everything everyone ever says or does directly to them?Bu the execution is clunky, and I don't believe this is the English translation. I've heard from others who have read both the original Chinese and the translated English novels, and it's the same in both.If I didn't already own the paperback of book 3, I would stop right here... but I shall continue the slog.I hope it's worth my time.
第692条评论: Amazing.
第693条评论: Mr. Liu has a good imagination. Don't believe you can predict the ending. From this book and its predecessor you will learn that the human species may be the most benign species in the universe. Now that is a scary thought.
第694条评论: This is a very well written book in a faithful translation. I enjoyed all the strategies two interstellar civilizations employ to avoid annihilation. The reluctant hero is just an ordinary man.
第695条评论: I choose this book because it was recommended to me. I was very happy with it. Was reminded why I love to read.
第696条评论: This was a real letdown after reading The Three Body Problem. Perhaps because this book used a different translator, and maybe something was lost in translation, but some of the characters and their motivations made no sense. Such as when some people obviously suffering from depression  wanted their beliefs modified to get over it, one character who seemed nice before yelled at them how disgusted he was at their weakness. This was done with no explanation. Other times instead of showing us how a character feels, the author merely tells us. This book was more concerned with moving a few plot points forward, and not at all with the characters doing the moving (even though they do a lot of exposition).
第697条评论: A dark second installment of the trilogy as humanity's hopes of resisting the alien invasion are decimated. Really looking forward to the third installment and how humanity and it's chosen anti-hero are able to survive the coming crisis.
第698条评论: As a Chinese reader, I buy this English version to see what is the new strategy for the U.S. Wallfacer. I do not think it is better than the original one. What if Ball lightening is translated into English some day?
第699条评论: Such a different perspective from a Chinese author but the humanity is the same.  Great story, interesting characters, fun science, and as in all great scifi a peek into what makes us human.
第700条评论: The unique plot that was hatched in the Three body problem is unfolded in this part. It is even more gripping and the solution is truly surprising. A real page turner.
第701条评论: Absolutely incredible. One of the most important books of our times. I could not put it down and surpassed the incredibly high expectations I had from the first book. A must read.
第702条评论: Brilliant view into human nature when faced with "external" threats.  Compelling characters, great writing and powerful translation.  I hope more of Cixin Liu's books are translated soon!
第703条评论: Picked up this series on a whim and it's rapidly becoming one of my favorites. Hard, philosophical SF done exactly right, with an overarching vibe that's refreshingly non-western.
第704条评论: Seems like all the characters were taken from a melodramatic Godzilla movie-drama queens all.  If you can get by that it has some interesting twists and turns but is by no means best sci-fi of the year.
第705条评论: As someone who appreciated but didn't love Three-Body Problem, this book was a knockout. While, similar to the first book, all characters are paper-thin entities pushed around by the sudden gusts of plot, those wooshes are much more regular, surprising and hilarious, and the two main characters are enjoyable and lovable if not complicated. Can't wait for the final book to be translated into English.
第706条评论: 5 stars
第707条评论: Simply put, I think his ideas coupled with his grasp of philosophic imperatives make for a great read through and through.  Refreshing writer.  I can't wait for the third book in the trilogy.
第708条评论: The fake Asian/Japanese accent in the audiobook is horrific. As is the fake spanish accent. Why are we still doing these stereotypes in the 21st century?
第709条评论: LOVED IT! I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say that Cixin Liu obviously put a lot of thought into making the reader think, this book although fiction is well researched & well worth your time!  At times it is a difficult read, but Cixin teaches some interesting concepts along the way.
第710条评论: This book is the best of the series.  I loved the main character.  The progress seems slow but eventually it will get to grand ending.
第711条评论: This is a fantastic read.  Second book of the Trisolaran Trilogy.  A book to read straight through to the finish.
第712条评论: Very thought provoking!On a par with the best I've ever read.
第713条评论: The second volume picks up from the previous story line and is mostly to do with the power play between Three-Body and the human race.  It started with drama and suspense, and it ended with action and thrill.  My most favorite scene in the book is when Zhang wakes up in his sleep, walks across the empty sections in the ship and comes to face the consequence of his action.  Reminds me of the character from Ayn Rand’s novel.  It is this moment that justifies my time spent on reading the book.  Totally worth it.  This volume will be one of my top five favorite SF fiction (and it will be a classic).This volume is a fast and absorbing read.  It is divided into three parts:1. Meditators.  Human has discovered a weakness in the Three-Body race and has created a Wall-facing program (the true objective of the plan has to be hidden) to prepare for the doom day war.  The program grants four meditators (or wall-facers) unlimited power and resources to carry out their plan.  Three-Body, through its supporters on Earth, has made a counter-move.  Four wall-breakers, one for each meditator, are assigned to decrypt the secret plan.2.  A Cosmic Curse.  Many years has passed since the inception of the Wall-facing program.  Two of the secret plans have been decrypted and failed. The third meditator has gone into hibernation.  The hope of the world rests on the last meditator, Luo Ji.  Luo has no ambition or interest in saving the world and has been using the program for his own personal gain.  The only reason Luo was selected into the program was that he is the only human Three-Body tries to eliminate.  As ridiculous as it sounds, Luo has put a destructive curse on a remote star.  In order to see the effect of his plan, Luo goes into hibernation.Note: I am not going to spoil the wall-facing plans here but they are all grand schemes and far-reach per se.3.  Dark Forest. Luo Ji awoke two centuries later to find the world a different place (digital age).  Earth has developed a space fleet that is far superior to the Three-Body’s.  The fleet has turned into a self-governing nation equals in right and authority as its Earth counterpart.  The wall-facing program is deemed obsolete and was cancelled.  The rest of the book tells the story of how the fleet encounters the Three-Body space probe and is where the actions are.Zhang Beihai, a colonel from two centuries ago, is awaken from hibernation to act as the chief executive commander of the fleet.  His role is to monitor the repressed escapists in the fleet and to approve and execute the orders of the flagship captain.  The moment Zhang receives command of the flagship, he carries out his life-long mission …What happens in the next thirty minutes in the book is the most mind-blogging space fight I ever read.The world is devastated when they receive the news from the fleet.  Out of desperation, the world reinstates the Wall-facing program and Luo Ji’s status.  Using the new found evidence, Luo spends the next five years fulfilling his role as the meditator.  The fate of the two worlds lies behind his resolution.Punch lines:Meditator: “this is part of the plan (so don’t interfere)”.Wall-breaker: “so and so, I am your wall-breaker”Earth Renaissance movement: “We have to be more civilized as time goes by, and not to bury our civilization in time’Zhang Beihai: “Natural Selection: Forward Advance power level four!”Food for thought:#1 rule of the dark forest: survival is the prime directive of any civilization#2 rule of the dark forest: civilizations grow but the total energy in the universe remains constantFrom realizing the dark forest rule to actual following it is a giant step humanity has to take.

第714条评论: I'm a huge fan of other sci-fi masters such as Isaac Asimov, so I'm hesitant to say this book was the best sci-fi book ever but it was certainly one of the best books. Like Asimov, Liu Cixin expertly navigated between fiction and societal analysis. I thought the first book was amazing, but apparently, the second book was even better than the first. There were so many twists that both made sense and that made me jump in my seat in shock. One tiny mini small criticism would be all the great powers of the future are still among the usual suspects, I wish the author was a bit more imaginative in that regard, but I wouldn't remove a star because of this.An absolute must-read for anyone who is interested in this genre.
第715条评论: Disc 2 is broken, really disappointing!!!!!
第716条评论: THE DARK FOREST is “hard” science fiction, a sub-genre of sci-fi that either sticks closely to facts and/or gives the greatest semblance of it when creating the technology featured within it. And, just like the first book in the  REMEMBRANCE OF EARTH’S PAST trilogy (The Three-Body Problem
第717条评论: ), he does this in spades. And, on top of that, his work is fascinating, his characters are realistic and his knack for quick, satisfying explanations of technological innovations is simply amazing.As the middle member of the trilogy, THE DARK FOREST is mostly “about” the coming of the alien Trisolarian army and Earth’s preparations for their arrival – and their plans to take over our world. But to try to explain this extraordinary work that simply is to do it an immense disservice. I often felt overwhelmed by Liu’s achievement, and the good news for readers is that this volume is only bested in those areas by the next book, Death's End
第718条评论: . That novel is really a towering accomplishment.But, for now, onto THE DARK FOREST. I could not count how often I felt WOW!-ed by the author’s refusal to obey the tropes of alien invasion works, by his startling innovations at every turn, and by all that he was able to create. He seems to thrive when he produces an almost impossible-to-solve situation, AND THEN somehow solves it. For instance, it’s going to take 400-plus years for the invading Trisolarians to reach here, but Liu creates sub-atomic “sophons” the size of a photon of light that are not only able to reach here as quickly as light, but are also able to observe our actions and in so doing, find sympathetic humans who are happy to see humanity destroyed and correspond with them.So how does one defeat these prying sophon-ic “eyes”? Well, Liu creates the concept of human “Wallfacers”: unique humans who will work in total secrecy with unlimited funds in order to come up with sophisticated strategies to defeat the Trisolarians…. things NO ONE else could have come up with. So how do the Trisolarians aim to defeat the Wallfacers? And so on, and so on…THE DARK FOREST is fascinating, deep, unorthodox and compelling, but author Cixin Liu makes you do a little work, too.  This is not a book the reader can coast through, and often requires the reader’s attention. While Liu’s brilliance at stretching the boundaries of the mind are inspired, these feats of intellect can be a little taxing. Simply put, the reader has to keep up. I think this might be a really good text to read via Kindle, as one can use it to search and recall characters and events mentioned earlier and then let go of for dozens or even hundreds of pages. One must also be patient: when waking up from hibernation a character encounters many, many references to a huge event called “the Great Ravine” for quite a while before an explanation is offered for the term. Another example is a so-called “spell” that central character (and Wallfacer) Luo Ji “casts” that takes an extraordinary amount of time to bear fruit, and the patient reader will be rewarded for waiting. But I can certainly see why some readers could be frustrated.Like author Kim Stanley Robinson, Cixin Liu doesn’t concentrate his fiction upon strong characterization or precise physical descriptions; but this is not to say there aren’t a few memorable characters.  I loved Luo Ji, who comes off like a latter day Lt. Columbo, the rumpled and clever TV detective played by Peter Falk. But his sprawling work has no problem using a character one comes to admire – like his police protector Da Shi, a man who is so sharp and on the ball that I would entrust my life to him in a heartbeat – but then Liu can just DROP him when it seems like the right time. But never fear, important characters abound in this work.For those who enjoy smart, unparalleled sci-fi  – and don’t mind a trilogy taking slightly more than 1,700 pages in doing so – you’re in for a hell of a ride.
第719条评论: This book’s story structure is a lot different than its predecessor. You’ll notice it almost instantly. Not that it’s a bad thing at all, because I think it is actually done pretty well but it’s definitely a departure from the first book in a small way. The plot itself is also a lot different. While the first book focused on things to come and kind of a preparation of sorts, The Dark Forest takes place at a variety of times and sees events foretold in the first book come to fruition. I won’t go into the plot too much for fear of spoiling anything but I really enjoyed the story. I will say that it is a bit abstract for sure. You’ll find the author meandering on pretty long tangents about topics that are either difficult to grasp or just very odd. However, many of the ideas presented are really interesting and unique so I found myself not bothered by the musings very much at all. One of the coolest things about this series so far is the clear demarcation among cultures. This is written by a Chinese author and it is pretty obvious. It’s really fun to see the small differences in customs and culture versus what I’m used to. There are also a lot of allegorical and historical references that I never heard before but translator footnotes really help to explain these and I had a lot of fun learning about them.Overall, the book is pretty cool. There are ideas in here that are pretty innovative and really make you think. The characters are also interesting and go through considerable personal journeys as they come to grips with the potential end of humanity or its salvation against the Trisolarans. There are some parts that lull a bit and sometimes the characters do things that don’t quite make much sense but given the immense scope of the series, these are easily overlooked. Lastly, the book actually goes somewhere. Many times it seems like middle books in a series kind of spin their wheels in the mud and more or less tease things to come. Not the case here. Some monstrous evens happen here and progress the story immensely which was very nice to see as a reader. I actually enjoyed this book much more than the first in the series and will definitely pick up the 3rd when it gets released in English.
第720条评论: I know it sounds silly when I say reading this novel makes me feel smarter. It's not the quantum physics, the string theories, all that high concept science jazz. I won't say that I understand all those theories in a million years, but the author builds and presents those hard sci-fi theories in a formula that makes an average person (like me) feel believable. What I mean by the "feeling smarter" part is that the author's boundless imagination really stretches my mind's horizon. I still can't believe all these fascinating ideas and plot twists are presented in one novel series (and we are only 2/3 through). Liu's complete dark, cruel and heartless cosmic sociology theory is really the best explanation of Fermi's paradox I've ever heard, consider we as humans, were this close to self-annihilation merely 50 years ago at the height of the Cold War, and we are really not that different from each other as a specie! The best scene (SPOILER) from the book for me was when the entire human space fleet facing total annihilation at the hand of one single Trisolarian probe, two ships tried to escape the onslaught by sacrificing their entire crews just for the hope of saving two useful spaceships for humanity, but to no veil. the brutally horrendous graphical description of their deaths, the devastating sense of complete hopelessness, really make those ultimate sacrifices speak in tremendous volume, what a glorious (but deep deep deeply heart wrenching) scene. I particularly appreciate the author's take on the many faces of humanity, the pessimism and optimism, arrogance and naive, suspicion and faith. Looking back at our history of thousands of years, humanity really hasn't changed, 400 years and more advanced technology sure aren't going to change much neither. Honestly I felt the ending was a bit let down, right after the climatic revelation of the dark forest theory. However, knowing that the 3rd installment is named Death's End, I can kind of guess where the story is going to turn, so I will take this seemingly happily-ever-after ending as a satisfactory plot device for the major plot twist that's coming later (matter of fact, seeing how Liu and his plot twists work, I'm almost certain of it. $hit is going to hit the fan, in a major way, in the grand finale. I am certain of it. but that's just my speculation). I agree with many other reviewers that character-building really isn't Liu's forte, the "dream girl" part is just, I can't put my finger on, does it do much to make the main protagonist a more believable/likable/more-rounded character? I don't know. But for Liu's weakness in character-building, he totally makes up for it in granderious world-building. in comparison to this beautifully dark cold world Liu built, I can totally overlook the thin characters.
第721条评论: Sequel to The Three Body Problem, this story picks up in the aftermath of the earth's efforts to halt a pending invasion by the Trisolarians, an extraterrestrial race that had discovered earth's human civilization by accident when a bitter Chinese academic, having experienced the upheavals and indignities of Mao's Cultural Revolution, decides to notify any possible civilizations in outer space of the incorrigible inhumanity of mankind. Because she had been drafted into working on China's radio telescope project, she suddenly finds herself with access to the technology to send a message to the stars and, in her bitterness, she does.Because of that action, the civilization of Trisolaris (a planet with three suns that interact in an erratic fashion) reaches out to earth and begins probing and recruiting allies across the planet from different nations through the use of a computer game to learn about earth's civilization and decide to come here, presumably to claim Earth for their own since ours is a more stable solar system than theirs (although this, it turns out, is something of a red herring). By the end of the Three Body Problem, it becomes apparent that nothing earth's scientists or governments can do will stop the coming invasion which, because of interstellar distances, is expected to take in excess of three centuries. As the Trisolarian fleet wends its way earthward, they use their superior technology, unfathomable by earthly standards, to impose a block on human scientific development, ensuring humanity will be unable to achieve their level of technology by the time their fleet arrives to replace mankind with Trisolarians.The sequel, The Dark Forest follows humanity's efforts to get ahead of the impending Trisolarian invasion, despite the quantum level blocks the approaching invaders have placed on human activity. Because the Trisolarians communicate by mind reading, they cannot grasp human minds which are different from theirs and so are reduced to communicating with their human allies (people so disgusted with their own species that they welcome its impending eradication by the Trisolarians) by writing in human languages.To meet the threat, humans, realizing that Trisolarians can't read human minds, hit on a strategy to defeat the aliens by identifying a group of humans who are charged with developing a plan to defeat the incoming Trisolarians without revealing it to other humans which would expose it to Trisolarian discovery. Four "wall facers" are selected and given the task, each to develop a different approach for dealing with the impending invasion some three centuries in the future. The availability of advanced technology, based on earth's existing science, which allows suspended animation, enables these individuals and others to operate in different eras of human history over the following centuries. In the meantime, confronted with the resource demands of preparing to meet an incoming alien fleet of immense but unknown capabilities, earth's various economies are taxed to the extreme and economic hardship and cultural disruption ensue.Of the four selected wall facers, one, the Chinese scientist Dr. Luo Ji, seems different from the others, his self-absorption and disinterest in solving the problem of the impending invasion, coupled with his unrealistic romanticism, making him an apparently weak link in the wall facer project. But as each wall facer's efforts seem to collapse, only Luo Ji, some two centuries later, may hold out hope for mankind in the wake of a preliminary encounter with the incoming fleet's advance probe. But Luo Ji, ever the inscrutable, is impossible to read, not only by the aliens he was supposed to deceive but also by his fellow humans and this is the crux of the novel.Written with a sensibility unfamiliar to westerners, this book is like a window into a certain Chinese way of seeing the world. Not only are the wall facers hard to read, all the human characters are. The author tells us what they do and say but his words generally misdirect. There's always stuff going on under the surface, left unsaid. We are asked to read the novel like a puzzle, not only to discern what humanity will or can do when the inevitable confrontation comes but even what the different characters mean when speaking with one another. Everyone is always fooling others, concealing his or her real thoughts. Perhaps this is a characteristic of Chinese culture where one often masks one's intentions with smiles and bows and indirect remarks.Whatever the case, the book is a fascinating, if sometimes fairly slow, read. Many times I wanted to skip ahead out of frustration with the endlessly roundabout descriptions of seemingly peripheral actions and events. But I was reluctant to do so because, with puzzles like this novel, one doesn't want to miss any of the clues. As it happens the real clue lies in the book's title itself, which appears unrelated to the story being told until very near the end when we learn that the real secret to meeting and surviving the incoming Trisolarians is reflected in its meaning.The characterizations are pretty flat but the philosophical considerations and the extent of scientific and technological speculation are impressive, making the novel worth reading despite the cardboard figures that seem to people it. This one, like its predecessor, is long and drawn out, and the society and worldview it gives us is pretty strange to my western way of seeing things. In the end I rushed through the last part to see if there was any way finally to out think and defeat the Trisolarians, given the tremendously advanced capabilities they had compared to those of puny earth.Cixin Liu's book presents us with a very dark vision not only of human behavior (see the aftermath of the battle with the Trisolarian probe) but with the nature of the universe and existence itself. One is reminded of the dark German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and his vision of nature as "red in tooth and claw."
第722条评论: Horrible
第723条评论: As someone who's been reading since And Earth Abides ... in the early 80s? ... I'm always skeptical of reviews here at Amazon no matter the subject: fiction/sci-fic/non fiction. I usually start with 1 or 2 star and see what happens. At 76 who has read thousand of books since the 1950s has little time to 'sample' here and there. I saw (almost finished after a couple of stops and gos) the 'movie' The Wandering Earth. It's a challange to finish it. It gives me an idea of the books it's based upon;
第724条评论: This second book in the trilogy is quite different in its writing from the first and third. There is a key difference that's probably why: the translator. In the first and third books, Ken Liu translates. The prose is graceful and clear, even when the concepts and situations are extraordinarily difficult (e.g., trying to describe a four-dimensional world). This second book lacks that grace. Joel Martinsen may not be at fault -- he may well have faithfully translated what was a lesser work than the other two books in Chinese, but I'll never be able to read the Chinese, so it's conjecture.Whether it's the original or the translation that is lacking in writerly grace, this book is nonetheless full of grand concepts, and Liu possesses an imagination full of stunning invention and philosophical ballet. The Dark Forest grapples with huge ideas, with humanity thrust into knowledge of a brutal universe it didn't know existed. Liu imagines the consequences over grand swathes of time, but pins the details to the stories of individuals who, thanks to hibernation, live through centuries of humanity's history as it becomes part of that dangerous universe. Those stories feel, for lack of a better descriptor, more artificial in much of this book, despite the grandeur of ideas.Stick it out through this second volume; when you're done, you can get back to the more fluid prose rendered by Ken Liu in the third book. The ideas in this trilogy are so startling, so worth contemplating that a few hundred pages of more stilted writing are well worth the voyage. Liu tells tales at the outer borders of imagination, and this trilogy's ideas will stay with you for a long time. It's hard science fiction, but hard science fiction realized at a remarkably advanced level, through a perspective that feels markedly different from the American SF tradition.
第725条评论: It's hard to know where to begin talking about The Three-Body Problem trilogy (officially known as the Remembrance of Earth's Past series), a truly staggering piece of science-fiction written by Chinese author Cixin Liu and translated to English by Ken Liu and Joel Martinsen (Liu did books 1 and 3, while Martinsen did 2). A trilogy that spans literally thousands of years, deals with quantum physics, game theory, sociology, religion, space exploration, space colonization, and more, all driven by the nature of first contact with alien intelligence - there's a lot going on in this series, and that's before you start realizing just how much Cixin (reminder: Chinese names are traditionally written with the family name first and the given name second) truly takes on the advanced science of his ideas. And yet, when you finish it, you realize that you've read something truly incredible - a piece of hard science-fiction whose ambition, scope, richness, and ideas are impossible not to find yourself thinking about for days afterward.Once you read The Dark Forest, the series' second volume, Cixin's ambition for this saga starts to come into focus. The question of first contact is settled, and the nature of the alien's approach is known: this is to be a takeover of our planet. But how can we deal with a race so much more advanced than our own, constant surveillance by extra-dimensional forces, and fractured elements of humanity working against us?If The Three-Body Problem was a first contact novel done as hard science-fiction, The Dark Forest is an alien invasion novel, albeit one in which the actual invasion is still many, many years away. It's the first time Cixin starts using hibernation to leap through decades and even centuries, spanning huge chunks of time as humanity changes and evolves in the face of an arrival which will change everything. As humanity struggles to find ways to either defend itself or show that it means no harm, the race has to deal with its own fears of inevitable defeat or a desire to retreat from the only planet we've ever known.It's not as if The Three-Body Problem wasn't already ambitious, but The Dark Forest is on a whole other level, dealing with interplanetary fleets, lightspeed travel, quantum computing, and more, watching as they evolve over huge swaths of time. But more than that, the novel is a deeply philosophical one, discussing the nature of life in the universe, questions about human nature and how we react in the face of threats, how we work together (or not), and game theory in how we try to handle uncertain intentions in allies and foes alike. Indeed, the central metaphor that gives the book its title (which doesn't arrive until near the novel's end) is a stunning one that helps you understand that what Cixin is writing about isn't just this particular alien invasion, but about the nature of all life in the universe and how we attempt to define ourselves in the face of reality.That Cixin does this while, again, mixing in such a compelling story (focusing especially on the "Wallfacers", a small group of people tasked with covertly planning humanity's resistance against the invasion) is nothing short of remarkable. The Dark Forest builds beautifully off of the questions and ideas raised in The Three-Body Problem, but turns them into something else entirely, changing the questions from "how do we initially react" to "how would we redefine ourselves in the face of such news". Far from suffering from any sort of "middle book syndrome," The Dark Forest is incredible, engaging with incredible concepts but never neglecting the human characters that anchor its massive scope nor the ticking clock at its story's core.To explain this series is a difficult challenge, to put it mildly. This is a series that spans a huge amount of time, deals with advanced scientific concepts in complex terms, grapples with rich philosophical and political ideas, debates questions without easy answers, and gives you a scope that can be daunting. It's a story of alien invasions, yes, but one in which the action sequences we're so used to are replaced with existential dread, a rethinking of our own lives, and a fear of the unknown that's hard to quantify. It's also the story of people caught up in these times, trying to give themselves a good life while never forgetting the larger questions of their era, and juggling their own fears with fears for humanity. In other words, it's what hard science-fiction is great at - thoughtful questions, big ideas, and speculation, all of which change the way you think about the world.This series is a truly incredible achievement, one that honestly left me a bit staggered and reeling as I attempt to think about it all, but one that I love all the more for what it accomplishes. If you're a hard science-fiction fan, or simply someone who loves dealing with the complex ramifications of common ideas, this is a must read series. I've never read anything like it in my life, and I'm a richer person for the ideas it's inspired me to think about.
第726条评论: A magnificent science fiction meets physics story, if picks up where the first book left off, carrying you both away and further from the earth yet closer to humanity.As an avid reader across fiction and non fiction genres, I have never read a writer who has presented such beautifully, poetic, descriptive language and turns of phrase before.The story and plot and character sketches are fascinating, but the writing is worthy of being read regardless of your literary interests.
第727条评论: Containing a little bit Spoil. Be careful.This English version changed its original plot and become totally different from Chinese version for the part about one of the Wallfacer.As far as I concerned, the changes influenced a lot in the characterization of that Wallfacer, and his character, therefore, had been influenced in some ways. 'Please notice the terms: characterization and character. Their definitions are totally different in plot-writing.) Whether this influence in character is good or bad depends on each reader. However, I am a person always prefer and respect the ORIGINAL ideas from the writer. (Not even for this book, but for many other situation, such as the changes made by GOT series. :( )These changes in the major plot, I heard from someone, had been requested by the US editor due to the reason that the original plan made by this Wallfacer was related to another book, "Ball lightning“ (also written by Mr. Liu), which were not published in English yet. In this case, Mr. Liu had to change the plot by himself. Frankly speaking, I do not think this request was a good idea. I had not yet read that book when I first read The Dark Forest (in Chinese), either!!! There was no problem to understand it AT ALL!!! The only consequence was that I then eagerly bought that book after finishing The Dark Forest. Why not keep this original plot and introduce the other book in the footnote? Maybe it will be published in English later, right?Then, strange things happened. Another character, Dr. Ding Yi, who also originally came from that Ball Lightning, had survived in this book, for the fact that he was so important and could not be replaced or deleted in anyway from this book. When introducing this character, the plot did mention something about Ball Lightning.Therefore, if you read The Dark Forest in English first, you might find some strange "evidences" left behind in the words just as the one I mentioned above. Here is another strong evidence: after this poor Wallfacer revealed his true plan to the hero, there was a paragraph describing the hero's internal activities, which containing some terms that related to the unchanged (original) plan but had nothing to do the changed one. You may also find the reputation of this Wallfacer shifted from time to time in different parts of this book. Finally, you might become confused, especially when you are not an original Chinese reader of this trilogy.There are always something could not be changed in a written book, even the changes were made by the original writer (under pressure? unwillingly? I suppose so.). Designing a story is a very complicated thing. When it is done, it should be done. For a book with so many intersections among subplots like this trilogy, it is almost impossible to change one of the subplot without disturbing the others or disturbing the overall picture of itself. If you were a writer, who have experiences in writing long stories, you must know what I am talking about. :) I am writing novels as well, so I know how these things going on.My conclusion is that this changes are not necessary, but they have not threatened the whole picture of this second book of the trilogy. Although it might become strange in those places I pointed out, the strangeness falls majorly on that poor Wallfacer (Well, I admit I like this guy in the original Chinese version better.) .Therefore, I gave this FIVE STAR to Mr. Liu, not for the editor or someone else who is responsible of this issue. I will not blame the translator, either. The translation itself is quite good. In fact, I read this one more comfortably than the previous book. Ken's work was also brilliant, but not as native/straightforward as this translator. The translation of the previous book tasted with more Chinese culture inside (I mean, not just the story, but the translation. Ken definitely understands Chinese culture and language better.), and this might be the reason why it is not so straightforward as this one. The two different style of translation both have their own strengths and weakness.p.s. I have one question for Joel...and for native English speaker here...Do you guys feel strange when encountering the term (appeared in the Dark Forest) "inquire one's mother"? The original words in Chinese version was "''xx'''", whose direct translation could be "greet one's mother". "Inquire", however, should be "''" or "''" in Chinese. They are quite different from each other and I was confused by this indirect translation. Well, you guys may be able to get the idea that "''xx'''" is a very suggestive term for that F*** word term. (Please do not tell me this word can not be existing in published novels. There are a bunch of them in GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire, and directly appeared in TV series. I read a lot of English novels, and F words are here and there, but I have never encountered the expression, "inquire one;s mother".)My question is...does this "inquire one's mother" term originally exist in English? If so...just forget what I am asking about (Maybe you can show some examples here, if possible). If not...do you think a native English speaker can get this idea easily from the translation without knowing the original Chinese term?Thank you in advance. :)Discussions are welcomed, for both opinions about plot changes and the little question above.

第730条评论: “We can never know about the days to comeBut we think about them anywayAnd I wonder if I'm really with you nowOr just chasin' after some finer day”Carly Simon’s 1971 song lyric pretty well sums up Cixin Liu’s second installment of his futuristic trilogy, “Remembering Earth’s Past”.Published originally in 2008, “The Dark Forest” continues its exploration of how Earth’s citizens react to the realization they are not alone in the universe. In fact, reasonably close in astronomical terms is another more advanced civilization, TriSolar, and its intentions are unclear.In this installment it is now known TriSolar has better technology and is reaching out to Earth in two ways, other than the communication links established earlier:• An advance surveillance system called “sophons” capable of inhibiting technological advances on Earth and eavesdropping on Earthling conversations (“sophons” are sort of combination of protons or electrons with nanotechnology operating in multiple dimensions as predicted by string theory and capable of exchanges with humans)• An interstellar fleet moving toward Earth but not expected to arrive for several light years (two – four centuries in the future)As might be expected, this realization with the lengthy lead time before physical contact sets in motion a variety of reactions: defensive measures, escapist groups and submissive or defeatist groups resigned to their fates. The dominant world order is following the defensive approach while suppressing the other two groups.  And the future society is living both underground in a sort of “Blade Runner 1982” world or aboveground in a “Blade Runner 2049” environment.Most of the story goes into lengthy detail about the successes and failures of these efforts. While some characters from the first tale appear briefly, developments are largely related from the perspectives of two characters: Luo Ji, a seemingly self-absorbed young scholar of cosmic sociology, and Zhang Beihai, a slightly older naval officer whose appearance seems to conceal much more below the surface.Several strategies are being employed simultaneously: creation of a Space Force (with even a passing reference to Donald Rumsfeld who probably originated the term) and the Wallbreaker Project designed to exploit a sophon vulnerability, the inability to read human minds – curious since people in the future world wear clothes electronically displaying visual images of their emotions.  Luo Ji becomes the protagonist for the Wallbreaker approach and Zhang Beihai for the Space Force.There is an intriguing meditation about how disparate civilizations in the universe (“the dark forest”) might or should react to discovering each other – sort of echoing Stephen Hawking’s cautions about interstellar contact – assuming there is a choice. As might be expected, by the end of this installment, nothing is completely resolved but left either with an unknown outcome or at a stand off. While very imaginative, getting there can seem long and at times overly explained.As a personal observation, there seems to be another, perhaps deeper, reflection being put forth by the author: the enigma of death and how each of us personally handles its impact on our immediate lives. While “The Dark Forest” is an entertaining tale about the possibilities of space exploration and interstellar contact, it really goes deeper into the unknown than at first brush.Perhaps Carly Simon’s lyrics had it right:“And tomorrow we might not be togetherI'm no prophet and I don't know nature's waysSo I'll try and see into your eyes right nowAnd stay right here 'cause these are the good old days”(For those interested in other authors using some similar concepts here are sources with permalinks to my Amazon reviews:• For extreme nanotechnology, William Hertling’s 2015 science fiction work, “The Turing Exception”: https://www.amazon.com/review/R7YHTFJX43971/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8• For space elevators, William Forstchen’s 2014 science fiction novel, “Pillar to the Sky”: https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R1VBHDIVLFPU63?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp• For discussion of current limitations to colonizing space, Michio Kaku’s 2018 work, “The Future of Humanity”: https://www.amazon.com/review/R2V624IFK7W8YT/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8)
第731条评论: The first book started a bit slowly but the story really took off and never stopped!An exceptional mix of hard science, sociology, crowd psychology and thriller, with unexpected twists and turns.Fortunately there’s not an overwhelming amount of dystopian themes to turn me off the story.The writing and descriptions are very well done, which is the mark of the best writers of science fiction or fantasy.
第732条评论: THE DARK FOREST - book two of the Remembrance of Earth's Past series - is the sequel to the Hugo Award winning THE THREE BODY PROBLEM by Chinese author Cixin Liu and translated by award winning author Ken Liu.  THE DARK FOREST is translated by Joel Martinsen, while the third book in the trilogy, DEATH'S END, will once again be translated by Ken Liu (I'll revisit the subject of the translators a later on in this review).At then end of THE THREE BODY PROBLEM, we know that the Trisolarans, an alien race from a system with three suns and whose system is collapsing, is planning a hostile takeover of Earth and are on their way to the Solar System.  They'll arrive in roughly 400 years, and there doesn't appear, on the surface, that anything can be done to stop them.  Complicating the issue is the presence of tiny computers made of protons called sophons, which can not only monitor all human information, but instantly transfer that information back to Trisolaris.  This has the nasty consequence of rendering transparent any plans humanity comes up with to try to stop the Trisolarans.  Yes, this is a bit of hand-wavium that may be hard for some readers to swallow, but in the spirit of the story as well as the spirit of the series (THE THREE BODY PROBLEM had its share of hand-wavium as well) I'm more than happy to ignore it.  This kind of hocus pocus was prevalent back in the day, and while it doesn't satisfy modernreaders of science fiction, I still prefer a bit of cosmic cool stuff in my reading (There is more than enough reading material and podcast discussion about actual science in science fiction to make it believable that I don't need to talk about it here.  I refuse to spoil my fun.).And so the "Wallfacer" project is born.  Each Wallfacer is charged with coming up with a plan to defeat the Trisolaran fleet coming to attack earth.  They are to do it in secret, not letting anybody know what they're doing, and they are given all the resources they need to accomplish their goal.  They have counterparts, designated by the Trisolarans, called Wallbreakers.  The Wallbreakers are to study their assigned Wallfacer until the figure out what that Wallfacer's true plan is.  One Wallfacer does not have a Wallbreaker.  His name is Luo Ji, who is considered by the Trisolarans to be the most dangerous of the Wallfacers.  While the other three Wallfacers are well known public figures, Luo Ji is a nondescript astronomer who doesn't understand why he is now the subject of all this attention and scrutiny.THE DARK FOREST, then, is the story of how humanity through the Wallfacers, and especially Luo Ji, try to find a way to fight the Trisolarans and defeat them.The story takes place in a couple of distinct time periods, with the second being some 200 years after the events of the beginning of the novel.  In that second time period, humanity feels that it has found a way to defeat the Trisolarans, and is no longer worried about the impending invasion.  Life has returned to normal.I hesitate to give much more in the way of details, because giving one detail will necessitate giving another, and another, and another, and so on.  Needless to say, and now that the book has been out for over a year, I don't think it's giving anything away to say that the Trisolarans are stronger than humanity thought, and that the technology that the humans have is powerless to stop the incoming invasion fleet.  As luck would have it, Luo Ji has a big role in the climax of the book, which sets the stage for DEATH'S END, the final novel in the trilogy.I had difficulty staying focused on the novel.  I did not find the characters engaging, and story did not hold my interest. Time and again conclusions were made based on what seems like intuition;  maybe it's me, but time and again one thing one would lead to another, at which point a character would say "ah, it must obviously be *this*".  And just about every one of those times, my reaction would be "Huh?  How did they come to THAT conclusion?"  Because of this, I found it difficult to engage with the story, to suspend my disbelief.  Funny, I know, that I'll buy the concept of sophons that can immediately transmit information over light years but can't but these character reactions.  And I guess that's the point - I couldn't believe the way the people were behaving, the decisions they were making, and the risks they were taking.  A great deal of it made little to no sense to me, and that took me right out of the story.What's good about it?  Grand concepts, space battles, mysterious aliens and their superior technology.  Cosmic ideas, the future of humanity hanging in the balance.  All that cool stuff.With regard to the translation of the book.  While I clearly do not know Chinese and thus can't truly judge as to whether this is a good translation from the Chinese or not, I can say that I wasn't as engaged by the style or the prose this time around.  I can only imagine how difficult it is to translate a novel from one language to another; however, I didn't find the writing as riveting this time as I did for THE THREE BODY PROBLEM.  Ken Liu returns as the translator for DEATH'S END.  I'm interested in reading his translation of that work.All in all, for me, a bit of a disappointment, although the book is saved by the grand scope of it all.  Hopefully DEATH'S END will pick it back up and send the story to the glorious finish I think it deserves.
第733条评论: Cixin Liu’s The Dark Forest generally operates on a galactic scale. But it starts with the perspective of an ant.The diminutive point of view is more than just an authorial flex (although it’s certainly that too). In The Three-Body Problem, the first book in Liu’s The Remembrance of Earth’s Past series, an alien race called the Trisolarans cuts off communications with humanity by declaring, “You’re bugs!” This isn’t just an idle insult. The Trisolarans are on their way to Earth, with far superior technology and a burning need to find a new world to colonize. If that means squishing a few (human) cockroaches to make room, so be it.Fortunately, it’s a long journey from Trisolaris (the invaders’ home planet): the bulk of the Trisolarans’ fleet won’t arrive for four hundred years. In theory, that gives humanity plenty of time to prepare. But the Trisolarans deployed scouts that double as technology blockers—humans can no longer use particle accelerators to obtain the deep understanding of physics necessary to compete against such an advanced species.The Dark Forest picks up as this realization sets in. Doomsday may be four centuries off, but few people think it can be avoided. Nevertheless, most of the world begins mobilizing for an interstellar war they expect to lose.Liu shows us this through new eyes (after he moves beyond the ant’s). Almost none of the characters from The Three-Body Problem carry over in a significant way, with the notable exception of Shi Qiang, a police officer who played a supporting role in the first book. Instead, we follow new players like Luo Ji, a run-of-the-mill academic, and Zhang Beihai, a political commissar in the Chinese navy.I wouldn’t have minded seeing more of Ye Wenjie and Wang Miao (the protagonists of The Three-Body Problem). But the shift of focus didn’t bother me much either. This series is driven far more by ideas than characters.One of the central thought exercises is working through how humanity would respond to an existential-yet-far-off threat. (The parallels with climate change are intriguing, except in this case, the Trisolarans represent a sentient, malevolent danger that’s harder to deny.) Apathy and defeatism manifest early, and Zhang and others work hard to cultivate a more optimistic fighting spirit.Liu is also excellent at projecting scientific progress in a way that seems plausible. The Dark Forest shows us some potential near-term developments like space elevators and then jumps ahead two hundred years to show us the types of leaps—touch screens on every surface; inexhaustible energy delivered via microwaves—that might be possible with sustained effort.At least one of his forecasts has already proven false, though. Liu wrote The Dark Forest in 2008, and one of its early movers and shakers is a fictional Venezuelan leader who “carried forward the Bolivarian Revolution instigated by Hugo Chavez … boosting the country’s power across the board and—for a time—turning Venezuela into a city on a hill, a symbol of equality, justice, and prosperity for the world.” If only. (Whatever you think of Chavez, it’s impossible not to lament the state of misery Venezuela devolved into following his death.)A few other devices strained credulity less tragically (like a spontaneous, near-telepathic exchange during a climactic moment late in the book). I also wish The Dark Forest had a more dynamic female character. There are women in prominent roles—leaders of international organizations and captains of starships—but they don’t get much time on the page. The active cast members are all male.But I still found The Dark Forest consistently interesting, and it ended in a more resolved place than I expected for the middle book in a trilogy. I’m curious to see where Book 3 goes—and what else Liu can dream up for me to marvel at.Note: Since the translation uses the English versions of the author’s name and his characters’, I did the same in this review.
第734条评论: I'm still able to read it.  and may just be being petty, however, the damage to my book gives me a headache.
第735条评论: Poetic consistently plotted alternative take on life the universe and everything
第736条评论: Book 2 of a great Sci Fi trilogy. Can't wait for the finale.
第737条评论: can't wait for the next chapter...one of the best serie I've ever read.
第738条评论: Simply superb
第739条评论: I kept waiting for the writing to get better. Interesting plot and setting but just not a compelling story teller.
第740条评论: Really looking forward to book3! Can't wait!!
第741条评论: A classic. I can't wait for the third book.
第742条评论: Amazing writer, amazing story.
第743条评论: 👍🏾
第744条评论: i am willing to read the third book in english version
第745条评论: What is gratifying is that the level of creativity is maintained from The Three Body Problem, perhaps even raised a half bar. I am totally glad to be flying onward into the trilogy. And for me at least, there is a satisfying ending, meeting the best I recall in reading sci fi since the early 60's. Yes, it's not perfect, but this novel could stand strong on its own even without two bookends. You will find a bump or two in fairly small details, but the story is amazingly coherent, sometimes eerily so, considering the risks Cixin Lui has taken with near term history. Characters are a bit closer to 3D than in Three Body, but this is not Dostoevsky, it's sic fi. I can't know the original wordplay, but the translation has a natural, easy feeling and succeeded in transfixing me a couple times. A crafty, dark uneasiness pervades throughout that reminds me of the horror genre, maybe like the mood of Dan Simmons' Song of Kali or Hitchcock. But it also breaks out with occasional jolts that kept me up late thinking, like great literature of any genre I suppose. I found the overall logic sound - the story works for me. So finally, after a thousand pages, I am wondering if Cixin's finale will leave me with the totally spent satisfaction of Asimov's Foundation trilogy back in the day, like a last glass from a great bottle. I will be finding out, as I imagine most every reader who gets this far will.
第746条评论: The second book of the trilogy is also midway in its style. Somewhere between the fantastical world-building of Death's End and down-to-earth conspiracy/politicizing of The Three Body Problem.The book is just as enthralling, and yet suffers from the same problems as the other books - heavy use of analogies gets a bit tiring, and I personally could not really connect to any one of the character's motives although the attempt to build more rounded characters is noticable.
第747条评论: This is not an easy book to read. The 2nd book in a 3 part trilogy the author has a sensational plot line, but he does meander quite a bit telling the story. A background in science-fiction, mathematics and computer science would be helpful for anyone attempting to read this book. It is absolutely essential that you read the "Three Body Problem" first.The plot is utterly mind expanding and his characters have to make some incredible hard choices, which may be difficult for some readers to understand. I was overwhelmed with the direction the author choose to take with his characters - Cixin Liu is definitely bold when it comes tothe plot line, but once he has the proper setting fixed he will surprise you with many twists and turns. Parts of the plot you will have to suspend your preconceived notions with disbelief and if you can do that, the story line will flow pragmatically foreword. Particularly I was stunned withthe choices made concerning the 7 surviving space ships after the annihilation of the space fleet. It was a necessary and correct choice for the survival of the human species.This book tells a tale rich in details, a lot of it has to be plowed through, but when you come to the end of the book - you will say WOW!For hard core science fiction readers this story is an absolute must to read. I highly recommend these books to the hard core science fiction community.
第748条评论: I’m excited now for the third on the trilogy and I’m glad that I have little idea where it’s going. While I don’t agree with the dark forest concept I can see it’s logic and in fact the entire story is well structured and interesting. The narrative does drag at times but it’s worth it in the end. Not as good as the first but the middle book almost can’t be by definition. Worth your time regardless.
第749条评论: Wow. I've been sitting here trying to write a brief but complete review of this book, but there's just so much going on, and on such a scale, that it completely defies brief description. In short, Earth prepares for alien invasion, given plenty of advance notice that it's coming, Each defense strategy fails, and fails spectacularly, always in different ways - perhaps reflecting the number of different weaknesses that the human mind displays. Since every effort seems to turn into its own counter, it's small surprise that a grand act of cowardice turns out to be a strategic master-stroke. It ends up irrelevant to the book's conclusion, but I imagine it setting the stage for spinoff stories in the future.Given the seemingly invincible technology of the invaders, you might as well wish upon a star for salvation. Imagine my surprise when, in the last few pages, I find that such a wish is actually the winning strategy.I'm eager to pick up the third book in this trilogy. For one thing, the ending of this book seems so satisfying in wrapping things up that I'm very curious about what more this fascinating writer has to say.-- wiredweird
第750条评论: Liu is so smart. I was floored by how interesting this book is, in the details and the high-level story. In the use of the old-timey police detective to move the bizarre story along. In the different perspectives of the civilizations, and the idea of wall-facers. The concepts in this book, I have never encountered anything like them. Three Body Problem was good, this book was amazing. But unlike the first book, it didn't have any strong scientific women, which made me a little sad. But I had to overlook it, because of how great it was.
第751条评论: Excellent second hard science sci fi. I want to give it 3 star because this translator doesn't compare to the first book, the story line is still excellent.  If you compare how the nuances of cultural mannerisms and postures are conveyed and visualizing environment and atmosphere building, Joel Martinsen is a disappointing translator compared to Ken Liu in the first book. Really disappointing.
第752条评论: This is easily the best Science Fiction story of all time. Cixin Liu's unflinching look at the reality of evolution is far better than the coverage of evolution in much of Science Fiction today. His Cosmic Sociology is one of the most brilliant ideas that I have heard of in a long time and far surpasses the evolutionary speculation that I have read from lesser authors, as if they don't realize that all their speculation is just design dressed up like a cheap ape at the prom. This combined with his idea from "Death's End" that differing races will tear the universe apart to survive and then just die after all that they have accomplished is survival makes this the hardest of Hard SciFi.This is real Science Fiction at its best.In the interest of full disclosure I wish to say that though I did not buy this from Amazon, I did check it out from my local library and read if from cover to cover. I have also read the other two books in this series and enjoyed them immensely. However, "The Dark Forest" is easily the best of the lot.
第753条评论: This is my feeling after finishing book 2.If "Three body problem" gave a ridiculous exemplification of human nature (the evil part), " The dark forest" provided a realistic one.Modern civilization helped us get out of the ignorance, but lead us to arrogance. People nowadays are so confident in themselves that they deny any possibility that they may be wrong in any issue, and these people are building blocks of almost all societies on Earth. Human beings are so satisfied with themselves that they ceased their ambitious plans several decades ago. Everything seems OK -- till the aliens come. Here Liu challenges the fragility of human society with his magnificent imagination. Everything under the sun is put to test, and this is not a usual drill. The performance of human society is a big F. My only concern is, if aliens is a real case, will humanity be able to survive? My answer is no!
第754条评论: This is my favorite sci-fi series, period.  It is refreshingly unique, not following the “main hero” or elevating the “everyman” into some sort of earth savior for a first encounter cliche.  Liu’s realism, and political observations set this series apart.There are no main characters, really.  Everyone is expendable. There are no clear moral teams to root for, just cold, hard sci-fi reality.  It’s definitely a more Eastern perspective, also one that shows our own civilizations pathetic egotistical needs even in the face of an overwhelming common enemy.  It doesn’t posit that aliens will somehow uplift humans into better people.  Instead it reveals our Biases and weaknesses.I highly recommend this book and the series.  It will completely shift your perspective, in a thoroughly enjoyable way.
第755条评论: It’s been two and a half years - and probably 120 other books - since I read The Three Body Problem. I’ve had friends crush them in a month and express their displeasure at books two and three.I’m glad I’ve chewed them slowly, truly modern masterpieces of science fiction.
第756条评论: This book takes the story and themes of the first novel from the near present to the far future. It continues the presentation of powerful scientific imagination, and fuses this again with a strong story line. As the narrative shifts several centuries forward, we move into a more standard scenario of space based interplanetary action. But the narrative never flags and the plot remains very original. The philosophical underpinnings are as strong and chilling as ever.
第757条评论: Good, interesting ideas presented in books, but details are poor. Psychology, sociology is on very low level, but high concepts are worth reading. Maybe I am giving it only 3 stars as it was far from best book I ever read, but the fact is that I bought all three from this series and I've read them all, and of course I don't regret it. So don't expect something super great, but if you will get it it won't be time wasted.
第758条评论: I like how different of viewpoint an author for a culture so different from mine can come to such an interesting conclusion about the world around him. I really like the analogy about the galaxy and universe being a dark forest, or a dark cave of ignorance, and the dangers fraught with revealing your presence.There seemed to be some plot aspects that could be ironed out, and the story seems to be a little all over the place, but I chalk it up to the difference in story telling evolution between Chinese and Western cultures. Good book, and I'm looking forward to the third in this series.
第759条评论: The concepts in this book and the one before it, were so thought provoking, surprising and unexpected.  The Wallfacer's part was so well played and had me fooled. Was so well done...will be reflecting on this for some time...
第760条评论: I really enjoyed the first book, but was skeptical of where Liu might go with the story in a second volume.  Boy was my skepticism misplaced.  This turned out to be one of the best books I've read in the last few years.  It has great story arcs, plenty of surprises, and an overall theme that is genius.  It starts out a bit slow, but by the second half, the book is hard to stop reading.  I'm looking forward to the third volume!
第761条评论: As soon as I finished the first volume in this trilogy, I was delighted to be able to read the second.  Like Aurora and Seveneves, this book imagines humanity's search for a way to survive a certain apocalypse.  Here, the people doing the imagining are Chinese, but the future will exist only with the cooperation of all human beings.  Can that happen when every time the Earth believes it has found a solution, the mysterious "enemy" planet who has made first contact calls "checkmate."
第762条评论: One of the better sci-fi books I've read.
第763条评论: I really liked this book, though not as much as  "The Three Body Problem," the first in the series. The story and writing are excellent (and, in many places, beautifully lyrical). The plot and its myriad of twists hold your attention and are entertaining and original. Why 3-stars and not 5-stars. For me, this book reflects too well what I expect would really happen if the seminal event of the book actually occurred. It's frustrating and disappointing for me to read about humans being "human." In the end, I really liked this book. I just did not feel good about having read it.
第764条评论: This book was a fantastic follow up to an amazing first novel. It is well worth the read. Enjoy it!
第765条评论: The Three-Body Problem rightly won the Hugo for best novel.  The Dark Forest is just as good but has been inexplicably ignored.  It’s even more inventive than the first, mostly taking place hundreds of years later.  It does dark right, including one of the most holy s*** moments I can remember reading in a long, long time.
第766条评论: I love this series and can't wait to read the third one. This one ended a little abruptly for me but still overall a good read and I'd even go as far to say a page turner! Highly recommend!
第767条评论: I loved this book. So much more than book 1, it had the creativity and involving characters, but the translation was so much smoother and more enjoyable. I did understand that they were going for a more sparse translation in the first book, but this was really a better experience. Some of the most important ideas I've ever read, and and I don't think I'll ever forget.
第768条评论: This is the sequel to the three body problem. Its not as good, but I was hooked so I read it. Seems like it could have been edited down by a couple hundred pages.
第769条评论: It's so rare to find a SF author who combines grand ideas with both interesting characters and superb line by line prose.  I give my highest recommendation for this book series, from somebody who holds authors to a fairly high standard.  There is a beauty in Cixin Liu's writing which is quite unique.
第770条评论: I'm with President Obama:  wildly imaginative.  A thinker; dense; had to re-read portions and refer back for clarification several times.  What an inventive, detailed mind has this author!
第771条评论: One of the most memorable, well thought out, and written sci-fi novels of all time!!! Some seriously unforgettable moments. A must read. The whole trilogy, this is the triumph
第772条评论: I read the whole trilogy and this was my personal favourite. I thought the story had intrigue, but was still well contained without going overboard.
第773条评论: As a disaster centuries in coming approaches Earth slowly, the varying reactions continue. Some still welcome eventual destruction, others look for escape, still others are confident Earth will be able to prevail. Wonderful plot twists and surprises.
第774条评论: I just loved this book. That is all. Well, amazon says I need 12 more words so here they are.

第784条评论: Just awesome
第785条评论: Book one was great. This book is so boring, unscientific, repetitive, flat, kinda stupid, etc etc. The first chapter is almost 200 pages of excruciatingly uninteresting nonsense that has nothing to do with anything anybody would care about. So many pages about his imaginary girlfriend, ugh. This book is a total cash grab based on the success of book one. Just awful garbage.
第786条评论: Very nice.

第789条评论: Brilliant
第790条评论: Now onto book 2, of The Three Body Problem, and it is hard to put down. First book was amazing, but I trudged through a little as I got into the mindset required to take in all the information. Once shifted into that thinking style, all went smoothly. What a story! I have strong synesthesia, and even while reading I hear and see and sometimes taste all that I am taking in. I can envision with great detail what I am reading, almost like I can reach out and touch it. This impacts my dreams (love dreaming of the elements contained in this story), and then come the next day I would have fodder to contemplate. Same holds true well into book 2.I am so stoked to have found this series. I'm impressed with the creative mind of the author, and I am appreciative with the efforts of the translator(s). I am reading this on my Kindle (currently poor eyesight is keeping me from grabbing paperbacks at this time, but I want to add a hard copy to my home library once I get good reading glasses or whatever I need). But one thing that I found that has added to my experience by reading on the Kindle are the footnotes. Be sure to click on them as you see them. I like the added info and context as I go, rather than having to look them up in the back of a book.Not all books/stories are for everyone.. and really, not everyone is for this story. But those who get into it, will be affected by it.Bravo!
第791条评论: Excellent piece of science fiction with a wonderful twist ending.
第792条评论: A very good story.  Nice to read sci-fi from a different cultural background
第793条评论: Better than Three Body Problem!  I really enjoyed how this book jumped us to the future.
第794条评论: Translated really well.
第795条评论: Wonderful translation of a wonderful book.  I could not put it down.  I'd put it with my favorites (Larry Niven, Stanislaw Lem, Olaf Stapledon).
第796条评论: masterpiece
第797条评论: Shipping: Received in good condition. The box didn't have any padding/fillers inside and the books moved around during shipping. It could've caused damage like it frequently does with book shipping on amazon. Fortunately, I didn't have to experience that.Book Review:This is a [put multiple positive adjectives here] book!It was so much better than the last entry. The rough edges are smoothed out, the story progresses quite well. The journey of Luo Ji was truly fantastic. And the sci-fi part of it was something I'd never experienced before.Not all of it was good though. There were some convenient one-liners/paragraphs to explain how humanity never learns. Like how they treated Luo Ji. Sometimes I wonder why the author insists to paint a nihilistic picture even though that logically shouldn't have happened. There were also some plot holes that were roughly patched.But putting all these aside, this has been a journey worth taking.
第798条评论: This the second book I have read by this author is full of great characterisation, and I triguing ideas. S I fi for adults.
第799条评论: Excellent book! The plot, the character development, the world building of both civilizations, are thoroughly engaging and highly readable. The implications of the Dark Forest on the Fermi Paradox, however, are rather depressing and frightening.
第800条评论: Very good sci fi book.I am waiting for a new book of this author.All trilogy is very good.
第801条评论: Very well thought out. The character development is outstanding. No loose ends and a very satisfying ending. Can't wait to begin the third book!
第802条评论: While enjoyable not quite as good as 3 Body
第803条评论: This is the First time I've felt the need to review a book. The dark forest is an intelligent and engaging read for all those who like SF. Interesting characters, good plot, grandiose scope. Cool stuff.
第804条评论: If you like hard sci-fi and epic sagas that question our most basic fears, needs, drives and pursuits as a species, then you'll enjoy Dark Forest. Well crafted.
第805条评论: [...]this video is super amazing. Produced by reader who like that book. Demonstrate how dark forest work.

第808条评论: Fantastic book! I have read it for at least 3 times. I am totally shocked by the writer's amazing imagination.
第809条评论: Full of surprise, can't put it down. The book has some deep thoughts about the essence of both science and sociology. The main character, Luo Ji, is much better developed than the characters in the Three Body Problem
第810条评论: Breathtaking!!!
第811条评论: Just finish all three books today and i can sure you that the third book is the best one.
第812条评论: I am struck by how even a translated book carries culture with it , but this book doesn't require a knowledge of Chinese culture to appreciate.  Well plotted.
第813条评论: #Spoiler Warning#Rest assured the 'seed of love' will never sprout in the dark forest.let's wait and see how ‘love and peace’ is to destroy the whole universe in ‘Death‘s End’~
第814条评论: amazing
第815条评论: Not as good as the first book, but I'm hooked to see how humanity eventually interacts with the Trisolarians. It is also a change of pace reading an author that is from Chinese culture and history. Although the translation does try to "westernize" some of the colloquialisms, they are sometimes obvious given most of the book is from a Chinese angle. Still a good read.
第816条评论: What a fantastic series and this book didn't disappoint. I found myself unable to sleep as I needed to keep reading the next page. Brilliant philosophical questions weaved into the story of a big what if question of the universe. What if we are not alone?
第817条评论: I am reading it now (slowly). Very interesting and a different scenario.  I am reading it in spurts to assimilate the response to the alien menace.Part of a series by a Chines author which brings a different cultural orientation to the story.
第818条评论: Part of a series. Read all three books. Worth your time. Interest that it’s a Chinese author translated to English.
第819条评论: I loved how different Dark Forest was compared to Three Body. Different main character, different time period(s), different philosophical considerations. Really fascinating concepts that make you think deeply. I literally had to put the book down several times just to stare pensively into the distance
第820条评论: This is nothing like the first book. Its characters behave like a bunch of idiots. Consider:1) they accidentally discovered a way to manipulate people’s beliefs and the UN decided to approve development and deployment to help people believe in wining. That is all. And not one member argued about the potential for stealing this crazy dangerous device or abusing it. Surprise surprise: 5 out of 6 devices and associated super super computers were stolen and abused.2) an unknown probe gets into the solar system and the whole space fleet goes to intercept it. The whole fleet. No space ship left behind, none was being repaired or was on any other duty. Every single ship went into a single place at the same time and very close to each other. To see what the one unknown probe was about. When the attack started it took them two minutes to wake up from the shock. No plan B.Can it get any dumber than that? Apparently yes. People panicked at the power of the invaders. Not about the stupidity of their leaders.It is a good thing I didn’t order the 3rd book of the series in advance.To be fair, even in the 1st book plot holes had started to form and should have send warnings signs
第821条评论: Through 2 of this trilogy now and this is a great writer. Fascinating Science and huge philosophical and political issues. Such as, how do you survive in an ugly world without becoming ugly. This is very much the opposite of the "E.T." noble extraterrestrial genre.Fantastic stuff. Stunning twists. Hard to put down. Cixin Liu is a genius.
第822条评论: Thank you, Mr. Liu, for providing to me a wonderful and stimulating mental escape during this pandemic through your trilogy.
第823条评论: A very creative follow up to "The Three Body Problem."  Very thought provoking and entertaining  as to what might happen if human beings encountered the strange and advanced Tri-solarian race. Main problem I had was adjusting to the "sino-centricity" of the main characters. But this is not really a negative factor in the storyline -- the magnitude of the fictional situation with encountering the Tri-solarians would affect Chinese people and everybody else.
第824条评论: This is an extraordinary science fiction book with many original ideas and excellent writing. It is not a turnpager story but if you want brilliant ideas and lots of science, it is well worth the effort
第825条评论: I listened to the Three-Body Problem through an audiobook format, and I loved it. I went straight to the sequel (also audiobook), and while I still really enjoyed The Dark Forest, I found the audiobook narrator very distracting. Without giving spoilers, the second book is more international than the first, and there are characters from different nationalities who all converse with one another. To differentiate between these characters, the audiobook narrator uses very exaggerated accents. It was distracting and honestly offensive at times, particularly with the way he speaks as Asian women.So yeah, this is a wonderful book but I would avoid this particular audiobook if you, like me, would be distracted from the action of the book by problematic imitations of international accents.
第826条评论: The Dark Forest is the continuation of Cixin Liu's multiple award-winning masterpiece, The Three-Body Problem. The title is a direct reference to Liu's vision of the universe as an arena of hostile civilisations competing for limited resources (i.e. a dark forest that is full of lone hunters stalking each other). It can also be interpreted as an allegory of humanity's own descent into darkness in the two centuries following the discovery of the Trisolaran threat.If you have read The Three-Body Problem, then you would know what to expect. Liu's writing style is as inelegant as ever, with cardboard characters, strained dialogue, sluggish development and clichéd plot devices. Having to narrate newscasts on TV to move the story along, for example, (multiple times, on top of it), is one of his favourite tactics - and scarcely a mark of good writing.However, just like The Three-Body Problem, the Dark Forest also offers remarkable ideas, great science and amazing insights into human nature. The idea of the Wallfacers was particularly enthralling – just like the "Dark Forest" as an explanation of Fermi's paradox. Something of a particular interest for a Westerner is Liu's brutal honesty when he dissects problems like defeatism, escapism or despair, where he both takes a unique Chinese angle and offers a refreshing alternative to the usual upbeat American heroism.I had one genuine laugh when I read about Hugo Chavez's successor who had turned Venezuela into a blooming garden using neo-communist policies. I think the Venezuelans who queue for hours to buy toilet paper will strongly beg to disagree.
第827条评论: In "The Three-Body Problem," Liu Cixin presented a strong case that human beings don't really deserve to continue their violence and destruction of the planet. One of the protagonists, in fact, purposely gave a predatory species Earth's cosmic address so it could come and either make humanity straighten up or eliminate it entirely.In volume two, "The Dark Forest," Liu then ruthlessly lays out reasons why alien species can be no better when it comes to morality and ethics due to the imperatives of survival and competition. (Oh, and he also continues to point out how human beings cannot rise above those imperatives either, and must commit "evil" acts in order to preserve their existence.)Still, Liu is chock full of interesting ideas, which makes "The Dark Forest" worth 3.5 stars (I always round up), but it would have really helped if this 512-page book were about 100 pages shorter. The pace is ponderous and there are not enough surprises to justify the word count.That said, I will read the final volume just to find out if Liu can tease some light out of the philosophical darkness he has evoked, or if he extends his dyspeptic vision of reality even deeper into the fundamental axioms of the universe.
第828条评论: Having recently flown through the excellent Three Body Problem, I found The Dark Forest a far clunkier and disjointed read.In the Three Body Problem, Ken Liu's translation managed to maintain, I think, the lyrical nature of the originals Chinese style, at the same time presenting a ground breaking first-contact novel that was palatable to a Western audience.  The Dark Forest, although a very readable second chapter, seems to be mired in the strict nature of the Chinese. There are a great many sections here, in dialogue, science, and description that would flow much more evenly to a Western reader with better pacing. It's with pleasure I note that Ken Liu is translating the third book Death's End.But this does not distract from the fabulous overarching story of Mankind's attempt to process the knowledge of, and meet, an invading force expected some 400 years into the future.As the international strategy to deceive the alien invaders progresses, always hindered by the technological cap imposed by the sophons, mankind moves out into space and struggles internally against depression and apparently overwhelming odds. The middle section of unbridled prosperity and hope is a dream like montage and is cruelly and vividly brought crashing down. The final third is climactic but also feels rushed. It is a sprint through disaster to the end of the book, with a great many threads being pulled and coincidences happening, just-so. Important characters know exactly where to be and when and nothing hinders our hero in any significant way. The denouement is also ever so slightly underwhelming and tied up too quickly and neatly.The Dark Forest is such a disparate novel that all three sections could very easily be fleshed out into three separate novels of their own. I’d have very much enjoyed seeing Luo Ji’s struggle through the final third handled with greater emotion and depth; a rite of passage or savior in the wilderness plot a la, McCammon’s Swan Song. To have seen his waking up and rehabilitation into the almost magical post Great-Ravine world of the second section and obviously the machinations of Wallfacers and Wallbreakers of the first third could almost be an engrossing spy thriller in itself. Niggles abound about how Banks or even Steven King would have handled this story.But these are all minor quibbles. I am genuinely involved in Cixin Liu's trilogy which is marvelously readable, truly epic in scope and adventure and promises very great things for its third installment: Deaths End.
第829条评论: Very well written story, with a unique and interesting plot. My only critique is that the storyline took too long to develop in this second book of the series. I almost stopped reading it a couple of times, but I'm very glad  that I stuck it out and finished it. Looking forward to reading book three!
第830条评论: I’ve rarely read a sci-fi series that’s so consistently hard to predict. Breaks so many genre conventions in really great ways.
第831条评论: I loved this book. The first part of the trilogy was great, but this one manages to elevate itself above that. All the aspects that made the first book so good can be found here. There's some good, and interesting science here, which provide food for thought as well as a framework for the story. Being told from a Chinese perspective gives it a fresh feeling - I get the same sense from some Russian sci-fi as well. The cultural differences provide an additional layer to the tale which I appreciate.The opening scene grabbed my attention immediately, and it's cleverly told from an ant's perspective, which helps bed the thought of the dark forest concept. In a book full of fascinating ideas, this really stood out for me, and on occasion I found myself musing on it.The book is split into two, the first half concerns humanity's preparations for the alien invasion. The presence of the alien technology limits options, although many of the developments are as you'd expect, there's some different ideas here. The author does a splendid job of conveying and inferring a lot of information, without being bogged down in too many details.The second half takes us into the future, and again the author's imagination is evident with how society has changed. The culture shock of those who awaken into this new world is well described, and brings a human element to the story. We see the ingenuity of humankind, but also learn more about the full capabilities of the Trisolarians before they reach Earth.The only real issue I had with the book was one of the aspects of its conclusion. The ending itself works well, and fits the build-up, while still leaving the story open for the third book. But there's a part that's related to the human condition that is often used as a fundamental truth, or key difference for humanity, and for me it feels a little overused. Although many great sci-fi authors have used the same construct, so maybe it is a fundamental truth :-)With the two books so far, I think this trilogy stands out as some of the finest modern science fiction. It demonstrates great imagination, but also understanding. These are books that any fan of the genre should check out.
第832条评论: First, let me say that The Dark Forest is a much, much better book that the Three Body Problem.  While the first book in this series took a maddening series of digressions that added nothing to the story except to slow it down in order to build suspense, the Dark Forest is almost all meat and no filler.The other thing that is striking about this book is how different a point of view it presents than western science fiction.  Although the first book tells a cautionary tale about how political ideology led to abuses during the cultural revolution, this book wholeheartedly adopts the Chinese Communist view that correct political thinking is of paramount importance to solving a global crisis.  Thus, it is not only the alien's efforts to block technological advances that challenges the human race's efforts to survive, but it is also wrong thinking that sets us back.  Thus the need to send military political officers into the future to combat perils such as Triumphalism (overconfidence) and Defeatism.  It is particularly interesting how the people righteously stand up to the Escapists, who want to selfishly leave the doomed Earth and live elsewhere.  Whereas in Stephenson's Seveneves the people of Earth find it rational to unite to save a remnant of humanity, Liu indicates that such a solution is unacceptable because saving selected individuals is unfair to the collective.  While us Westerners can understand Stephenson's point of view, Liu's seems incomprehensible to us.But does Liu really believe that ideology plays a key role in his story, or is he merely putting that stuff in to appease the government censors?  We cannot tell, because like the Wallfacers, citizens of China can only be judged by their actions, while their true thoughts remain hidden inside.  Thus, Liu's criticism of Escapism may actually be a sly dig at the Party elites, who outwardly preach that the welfare of the collective is paramount, but who enrich themselves and their families while enjoying perks that the masses can only imagine.  The exposure to Chinese thinking this book provides is indeed akin to first contact with an alien civilization.As for all the accolades from readers for the hard science content, I find the concepts of the Sophons and of using the sun as a radio wave amplifier to be palatable, but dubious.  Compare the "hard science" in this book to the exposition of orbital mechanics and genetic engineering in Seveneves and you'll see what I mean.
第833条评论: After just a few pages, I was wondering if it was me whose first language was not English, or translation that hindered smooth progression.  Based on the quality of the first book, I discarded the notion of a poorly written sequel, and kept reading because I believed it shouldn't be that bad.  On the way going forward, I found a few typos, unnaturally long sentences, and even inconsistent styles, which confirmed my initial suspicion.  It was surely bad translation probably through a few stop-and-resumption cycles, which I experienced a lot in many foreign-written books translated into my mother tongue.  At minimum, it could have been a lot better.  I'm glad that the final book is translated by the one who did the first book.  Of course there are some weaknesses already presented by the author, especially unnecessarily tedious development in a few scenes, but most tech-centric literature, SF or military, somehow have the weak spot.  Considering all, I still enjoyed the book, and now look forward to reading the third one soon.
第834条评论: As other reviews have stated, this book has a mixture of complicated alien concepts like the Fermi Paradox, which asks "where are they?" (the aliens) to how many are there? (the Drake equation) but in any case, if you like hard science fiction like the Martian, or ensemble-style science fiction like World War Z, this book is you. As good as the previously mentioned masterpieces, in a genre that's desperate for good titles.There is some weirdly simplistic dialogue, and some laughably socialist concepts, like the guy who made Venezuela into a socialist paradise (obviously this was written before the current disaster) but if you can put that aside, the concepts and story are worth it.Contact was made through a faster than light device, with a species called the Trisolarians. The Trisolarians are an advanced race, but primitive in their honesty, and horrified when they learn that the human mind is capable of deception. In their horror they launch an invasion fleet, and since they can't lie about it, tell us so. When asked what we can do to try and make it right, the answer is "Die, please. No offense." Not in those words, but that's the gist of it.Humanity drafts some dudes with huge, bulging brains to come up with plans and strategies to meet the alien fleet and save the world. These bulging brains are called Wallfacers. Hey, Liu's a little weak on names, but maybe it sounds cooler in Chinese, instead of in English where it's a guy who's to afraid to ask a girl to dance. But I digress. One of the Wallfacers is the Venezuelan hero, which is appropriate, if you can get Socialism to work without a bunch of people standing in line for toilet paper, defeating advanced aliens should be a walk in the park.There are large space battles, with some predictable outcomes, but I'll give Liu a pass, his characters are interesting, and his descriptions are full. While the space battles are predictable (not all of them) there are some great plot twists, and the book as a whole will keep you up at night.
第835条评论: Intriguing premise and good story.
第836条评论: Read it the forth time now.
第837条评论: Very original
第838条评论: Engaging. The eerie sense it is real.
第839条评论: Just epic.
第840条评论: Disappointing.  The premise is really creative, but the execution, not so much.
第841条评论: Thumb's up
第842条评论: One of the greatest science fictions!
第843条评论: Couldn't put it down.
第844条评论: Best of the best, believe me.
第845条评论: Good read but this book 2 of the trilogy got a bit long-winded at times. Presents an interesting line of thought as to why it may not be such a great idea for humanity to advertise its presence in the cosmos. But then, love could trump it all :-)I wouldn't call it a page-turner, but 4 stars for presenting the idea in a nice sci-fi context.
第846条评论: Putting it against the first book in the series, I really enjoyed this one. Don't know why exactly, but I felt the connection I did not with Three body problem.I still have problems with chinese names and not remembering at times the sex of the characters, but that is a problem of mine, not something that should be the same for everyone.
第847条评论: I almost gave up on book 2 of the trilogy because it bogged down midway.  However, the story accelerates during the final third with an excellent ending.
第848条评论: I would recommend this, not only to fans of science fiction, but also to anyone looking for a well done book. Read the books in sequence though. I listened to the first one as an audio book, but enjoyed reading the second one much more. Pronunciations are a challenge but the story itself presents none of the same problem.
第849条评论: Great sequel to THE THREE BODY PROBLEM.
第850条评论: The Three Body Problem series compares favorably with Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamozov in both probing fundamental questions while entertaining, a rare achievement and a treat to read.
第851条评论: I'd really give this 3 1/2 stars. Cixin Liu is a genius at some things - the evolution of the WallFacer strategies is really interesting, and the idea of some kind of cosmic sociology with certain logical conclusions - it's all quite mind-blowing. But he has some weaknesses as a writer, in particular the establishment and development of character. I'm not the first to complain about this. His characters are pretty flat in general - they serve the story but as a reader I don't feel that interested in them. Overall this is a good read but sometimes it's a slog to keep going - however, if you persevere to the end you'll be rewarded. I'm looking forward to reading the third part of the trilogy when it's available in English in 2016.
第852条评论: This one builds more slowly than the first one and parts of it did not resonate for me. However it ends very VERY strongly. The last section rescues the book from being in the 3-4 star range up to the 4-5 star range. Luo Gi is a much more interesting main character than the main character(s) from the first book (except for the despicable Ye Wenjie of course).Plus there are other characters we get to know and identify with whose fates are known by the end of the book and whom the reader becomes invested in and sympathetic towards.Liu does an excellent job of portraying the far future and depicting what world reaction would be as human extinction became more and less certain depending on events in the book.I think this will be a contender for the Best Novel Hugo, but like Leckie, probably not win it.
第853条评论: To say this book changed how I think of extraterrestrial life is an understatement. The main thesis of this story as well as being the title of the book will both excite and frighten you. I can't expose more without ruining plot points but the main premise makes the author a true genius within the science fiction realm. Besides the plot the character of Luo Ji is truly someone comparable to one of the heroes of Asimov's foundation trilogy. I came to care and love for this character to the point where I feared for his life continuously throughout the novel. It speaks to the authors talents that he not only gave a great story but characters to love and hate. A great sequel and  must read for science fiction fans.
第854条评论: As a sequel this was amazing because, while it continued the story from the first book, it was also almost entirely independent of the first. Different characters, different setting, different everything. The first book was largely historical, with lots of movements back and forth in time. This one was mostly far future, told in a linear fashion.  Yet it continued themes from the first regarding its fascinating exploration of both psychology and science.  The one thing that bothers me is that in both books story lines that seem to be important just disappear without a trace. I guess this is offset by the impressive way that things that seem trivial emerge as critical.  All in all very good story. I'm relieved and perhaps a bit inspired that he found a way to end this rather despairing book on an upbeat note.
第855条评论: A guide to the time in which.  If you find nothing useful here,  because you are quite comfortable with the status quo, yet you may come away at least mildly mind-stretched and. . . entertained!  In the tradition of PK Dick's VALIS trilogy,  but 3 Body hinges on virtual reality where Valis hinged on alternate reality, as the Human Mind continues opening.  Also, where the earlier opus had a theological focus, so far what i see in Cixin Liu is a political focus.  Anyway, a fine sci-fi read.  A whole universe is where the action unfolds, and all of humanity is in danger of subjection or annihilation.  And fun, to see recent history--since the sixties,  anyway--through Chinese eyes.
第856条评论: I loved this entry in the series.  It builds solidly on the first entry while introducing a whole host of new characters, ideas, and plots that build to a satisfying conclusion. If you loved The Three Body Problem you will not be disappointed in the continuation of the series at all.This translation read much easier for a native English speaker than the version of The Three Body Problem as well.  Dialogue felt much more natural.I'd highly recommend this series for anyone looking for a new ambitiously large scale sci-fi series.  A wonderfully done take on first contact and the far-reaching consequences of a cold, logical, and ruthless universe.
第857条评论: The whole trilogy is so brilliant that it'd be impossible to find its strongest point.Yet this second portion is not only there to confirm all the greatness of the first one, but also to ensure you will absolutely want to read the final part.
第858条评论: Tremendous, high concept SF that belongs on the top shelf. I liked the first book enough to buy this one, and this one is quite a bit better than the last. I was really impressed with this and am anxiously awaiting the translation of the third book.The insane plans for the defense of earth become steadily more terrifying as they are revealed, and bring to mind the idea that 20 years ago we had guys actively planning how to wage global thermonuclear war. Some of the solutions presented are disturbingly plausible and it gives you a lot to think about.The writing ability in terms of pacing, characterization, etc is adequate but not great, at least to a western reader. The ideas and concepts are what pushes this one to the top.
第859条评论: A book so epic in scope that reading it only once is inadvisable. The second book in the “Three Body Problem” series is enthralling.  Written from the perspective of multiple characters, it follows humanity’s path from a largely terrestrial society to the beginnings of the true space age, where most of the planet has taken the rest of the solar system for their home. In 20 years, science fiction readers will be speaking of these works in the same way hey talk about Heineken, Asimov and Niven - a truly magnificent work for the ages.
第860条评论: It has a long winded presentation of the issue for some 3/4 of the book, but the end is good and captures you until you read the end. Recommendable book!
第861条评论: Straight off - I'm not rating this five-stars because it's flawless, beautiful prose.  It's a translated work and while the English is excellent, there is an underlying 'restraint' to the pace of narrative that I suspect is unique to the solemn calm of a schooled Chinese author.So why 5?  Because IMHO this is ESSENTIAL reading for any serious lover of science fiction.  I've rarely encountered such an eye-opening breadth of ideas and concerning philosophy about galactic expansion in particular.  But no spoilers.  It's worth the ride - make sure you read the first book "Three Body Problem".  And enjoy a very different, but very deep story.I'm completely perplexed by how the storyline is going to be continued in the third book - like a lot of graduation translations - the wait is the hardest part!
第862条评论: Like the Three-Body Problem, Liu Cixin writes with a lot of technical details and scientific thoughts in the book, which are super interesting to ponder if you enjoy technology and science. However, I feel the character development in the book is a bit lacking and the characters are not super robust. This would be my only critique of Cixin's writing. Yet I still very much enjoyed this book as well as the Three-Body Problem because the scientific philosophy behind Cixin's writing is very entertaining and interesting. I will most definitely read the third book in the series when it comes out in English. If you like sci-fi, I definitely recommend reading this series.
第863条评论: My favorite of the three.  The 1st is very good and the third book is on-par in awesomeness, but Liu really REALLY stepped up his game from 1 to 2.  So much so that it felt like book 1 was an introduction.This is top-shelf stuff alongside Dune and Lord of the Rings.
第864条评论: This book itself is indeed a masterpiece, but this English version is dotted with some translate errors. For example:Page 364.“Too bad I never met her… How old were you when your sentence ended?” “Nineteen”The original Chinese version is “Too bad I never met her… The year that you came out prison was which year since you were jailed?” “The 19th year”Page 459.Blue Space and Quantum had come from a world of light, but they had become two ships of darkness.The Chinese version is “Blue Space and Bronze Age had come from…”Page 469.Like Zhang Beihai two centuries before, Luo Ji suddenly found himself hating that he was an atheist.The Chinese version is “Like Wu Yue two centuries before…”Wish those errors could be corrected in the next edition.
第865条评论: Seems like the translation was somewhat rushed on this one. They should take another pass. Comes across as a bit more forced than the first in the series. Still has some great concepts and material.
第866条评论: Couldn't put it down. Space opera at its finest.  Liu makes what seems simple and even mundane compelling and significant. Deep and challenging and very compelling. Been reading SF for over 50 years and love it when I find something different. This trilogy is all that and more.
第867条评论: I read the first in the series and loved it - something fresh and new in the Sci Fi world.This one however was tedious moving along at the speed of a Chinese Junk.  If you have not read the first one you would not have a clue what it was all about.  No action to speak of but plenty of dialogue interspersed with an "afterthought" Trilosorian scene.  Again it would make no sense to someone who had not read the first one (Three Body Problem).  It seems as though the author's imagination was exhausted in his first book so I do not think I would be interested in the final book.
第868条评论: Liu takes you into a mind-bending future where new laws of science and physics exist, but because of how he tell the story, it all makes perfect sense.
第869条评论: Good story with (quite) high credibility and some good surprises. The style is ok. How the characters are presented and evolve is below average.
第870条评论: This is simply excellent science fiction. No question where all the awards come from. I think the author/translator got a little indulgent with some of the prose in places which is why I didn't give it a full 5.
第871条评论: An amazing sequel to the first book. Rare that I can say it, but I think the sequel was better than the first. Great characters and plot reveals better than some mystery books. A dark and unique view of the universe that I'm glad I read.
第872条评论: This is an amazing trilogy. I can't wait to read the last book.  I think the translation is good but then I haven't read the Chinese version, yet.  But the translation of the cultural references are on point.
第873条评论: This book was slow to start for me after devouring Three Body Problem, however, about the midpoint it started to turn and I read the second half in just a few days.  A very good followup to Three Body, and probably better translated, and with better pacing.  I cannot wait for the final book.
第874条评论: Wow. Great follow up to the first book. With so much poor SF writing out there, it's a pleasure to read something original, thoughtful and so good at capturing what humans are really like.  Up there with Asimov for making characters come me alive on the page.
第875条评论: This trilogy is awesome for any science fiction lover.
第876条评论: Must read!
第877条评论: the translator on this book isn't as good as the first and third
第878条评论: Everything about this poorly written book is ridiculous, beginning with the two so-called axioms of cosmic sociology and ending with the truly demented strategy of sending a whole fleet in parade order to meet an enemy probe of unknown nature! The language is curiously stilted, the characters are robot-like, and the Chinese military are described as silly puppets, which makes one wonder how the author is viewed in his own country.
第879条评论: A really breathtaking book that encompasses science, philosophy and narrative to keep the reader fully engrossed from start to finish. Don't miss it.
第880条评论: Fantastic sequel to mind-blowing story in "Three Body Problem".
第881条评论: Fantastic series. Really imaginative, and has a fluid style that allows for it to be read either for fun or as a more serious work.
第882条评论: An excellent continuation of the Three Body Problem.
第883条评论: The Dark Forest is a nice progression (perhaps even a conclusion) to the Three Body Problem.  The author tells an amazing story, and the conclusion was soon good that I sat in stunned silence for 10 minutes after completing the book.  Highly recommended.
第884条评论: Guys, if you like the scene when the droplet rushes to all the spaceships, here is a short video you can get the feeling from.[...]
第885条评论: My mind was blown wide open again and again and again. Only a genius could have written this. Do yourself a favor and read this deeply.
第886条评论: Marvelous book. A song for hope, resilience , courage,  believe and love.Not easy to read at the beginning, but you can't stop in the endClever, possible, unbelievable good
第887条评论: Not as good as the first book in the trilogy, not as bad as the third
第888条评论: This book was amazing, so much better than the previous one. Kept me guessing, was very unpredictable. Explores a lot of concepts in science and philosophy I've never even thought of.  It's a very easy book to spoil, read reviews and summaries at your own chance of spoiling it.
第889条评论: What a crazy take on Fermi’s Paradox. Will try to get back to this review another time, but such fascinating takes on human nature, shortsightedness, strategy, and sacrifice in humanity.
第890条评论: Amazing story! A worthy sequel to the 3 body problem. In fact much more griping. Looking forward to the next book.
第891条评论: Mmmm great book! Mmm loved the book. Mmmmmm I want more book. Mmmmm Give me more of the book please.
第892条评论: Liu has a very interesting theory about why we don't hear from other civilizations in the galaxy. And it is plausible.It reminds me of some episodes of the original "Star Trek."
第893条评论: This episode got moving much quicker than the first, and was an enjoyable piece of sci-fi.I'm anxious to see where the 3rd takes us.
第894条评论: An engrossing and interesting plot and characters kept me entertained throughout, even up through the ending twist. Enjoyed it as much as the first book!
第895条评论: Sci-fi that definitely has a cultural mix. Interesting, entertaining, like many middle-child novels, raises more questions than answers. Guess that's why there's a 3rd book.
第896条评论: A very good second book in the three body problem trilogy.  Though Cixin Liu presents a very dark view of humanity -- certainly a throw the lame overboard so they dont soak up resources for the rest of us kind of attitude.  The story moved along very well, I thought it was easier to read than the three body problem.  I dont know if this is in the original version but in the English version footnotes were included (I can see for Song and Ming dynasty literature but I wonder what they think of our science education when they feel compelled to explain the Strong force and LaGrange points)  Alas maybe our education system is that bad.  I recommend this story it is a fine and interesting read.
第897条评论: I found this second part difficult to keep a steady interest, it dragged on as the author tried to keep his timeline alive. The story is good but it drags and the characters loose their vitality.
第898条评论: Culturally, the book offers an insight to more group-oriented thinking and behavior present in different cultures on earth of course, but also uses language and syntactic flourishes that reflect a long tradition of Chinese poetry. Wildly imaginative visions of the future and engaging to where you won’t put it down!
第899条评论: The translation is not as good as the first book. It is a different translator who (unsurprisingly) has a hard time living up to the phenomenal translation of the first book.
第900条评论: This to me is a rare anthropological literary sci-fi apocalypse thriller.Can't say enough to convey the way the space based concepts of 'the dark forest' show how well the author has thought very deeply about existential cosmology. No need to mention any spoilers, but will say that the garden of eden references and the light vs darkness constant tension did create a moral vs evolutionary type of inevitability that I think needed a bit more explaining.  What I think I mean is that while the story is sweeping and covers immense spans and depths... some parts needed to go more in depth and others might have been abbreviated... but that's a nitpick so I don't just sound like a fanboi. Thanks Cixin Liu!
第901条评论: What I love most about this book (and series) is that it's based deeply on science but take unpredictable turns that in retrospect make lots of sense and you kick yourself for not seeing sooner. It's an amazing study of how humanity would respond to events we've never faced, and paints a realistic yet futuristic vision of how things could play out. I almost never write Amazon reviews for books, but it's good enough that I did. Read Book 1 in the series, then proceed directly to this one!
第902条评论: I don't know if it is a translation issue or a cultural issue but this book is not my cup of tea.I would like to think as an American, we would not just give up or even use some of the same strategy used in this book. I found this book bleak, hopeless, and at times just strange .
第903条评论: I was much more excited to read this book than the first, and took far less time to finish. I loved the mysteries of the Wallfacers and the jump ahead 200 years.
第904条评论: It meandered a bit at the end but there is fantastic symmetry in the book and I thought it was a really well written piece of sci-fi. I am looking forward to the last book of the trilogy now!
第905条评论: Great new ideas. A bit choppy
第906条评论: Transcendent.
第907条评论: I'm for sure in the minority on not enjoying this book, I really liked the first one, the second not so much, and the third not at all.  If youre a big Sci-Fi fan though I would give the trilogy a tryl
第908条评论: If  you at all like science fiction, you need to read this trilogy.
第909条评论: Superb
第910条评论: My favorite book in the series!
第911条评论: I read all three body book several times. THE DARK FOREST is my favorite
第912条评论: A very original idea and an in-depth imagining of how civilizations interact at a galactic scale.
第913条评论: This is one of the best SciFi books I have read and I started reading SciFi 45 years ago. Looking forward to #3
第914条评论: This was my favorite book out of the trilogy. A must read for any sci-fi fan.
第915条评论: This trilogy is the best sci-fi I've read in years. From philosophy to sociology to physics all the science is here supporting great characters and an epic story.
第916条评论: Great book. Great characters. Great twists. Great translation. Totally different than the first book but just as great. I could not stop reading.
第917条评论: The story is masterly told. The translation is superb. This is what SciFi should be. Recommend it too all folks you know
第918条评论: Brilliant imagery, sci-go with a psychological under current. Great descriptions of things you’ve never seen, but manage to imagine thanks to Cixins illustrative storytelling!
第919条评论: Good sify.  Well thought out.  A bit slow at times like 7 eves.  Well worth the read.
第920条评论: I have not read science fiction like this in recent times. Pleasantly refreshing. A book that made me stop and think on more than one occasion.
第921条评论: One of the best thought out and written science fiction I've ever read. Thought provoking.
第922条评论: The combination of advanced science and creative storytelling is unlike anything I’ve read in this genre. A tour de force work.
第923条评论: This series is one of the best sci-fi has ever produced. Stylistically i'd say it is most like clarke. Great story with big ideas, can be very dark at times with its content and outlook.
第924条评论: Very interesting story telling approach with a LOT of very thought provoking explorations of civilization and how the universe might treat us.
第925条评论: The parallels of this book to the life we all live at such grander scales was what made this book so much fun to read.
第926条评论: This book is a shattering reply to those naive souls who persist in SETI and alien-contact pursuits.  The 'Dark Forest Theory' is a serious thought provoking logical analysis of these issues from an unflinching scientific perspective.  Although not by name, its implications have recently been endorsed by Stephen Hawkings.  Anyone well versed in science fiction will recognize this novel as an outstanding achievement.
第927条评论: Even though The Three Body Problem wasn't very well written, it at least was somewhat intriguing. This book is just plain horrible. The dialogue is atrocious in parts. Some reviewers seem to want to put that on the translator, but I don't buy that at all. If that were the case, the whole book would be even worse than it is. The first half of the book is pretty much nonsensical due to the poor writing. The whole Dream Girl stuff is just sexist and ludicrous. Sending the whole fleet to investigate the Droplet is something no sane military commander would ever do. When the book starts having the three ship captains all of a sudden communicating telepathically, the writing hit a new low of absurdity.Regrettably, I purchased the 2nd and 3rd books after reading the first book.Honestly, it's pretty hard to believe that a lot of the glowing reviews aren't fake. I only have one thing to say about people claiming that this is the best sci fi book they've ever read: This must be the first sci fi book you've ever read to make that claim. It's garbage.
第928条评论: of different people on a different sets of paths that intersect in the world of ideas.  I look forward to the next set of journeys.
第929条评论: Liu Cixin is a fine 'hard' science fiction author as evidenced by this and the two previous parts of "Remembrance of Earth's Past" [S{ometimes}AKA "The Three-Body Problem" which is the title of the first novel]. The scope and characterization are exemplary! Be careful to obtain the translation unless you read Chinese!]
第930条评论: This was a weak follow-up to The Three Body Problem. Extremely formulaic, unrealistic dialogue, and a protagonist that was impossible to warm up to. I forged through and was glad to see the last quarter of the book finish on a higher note than the rest. I both listened on Audible  / read. I found the narration, insofar as pronunciation/vigor to be vastly different from the first -- the pronunciation of the names was so  different that I had to buy the book just to be sure which character was being referenced! What a pain!
第931条评论: This is the first time I have encountered this author.  His combination of hard science, relying as most SF writers due on some unlikely breakthroughs, with an incredibly complicated but very realistic plot, puts him ahead of even Clarke.
第932条评论: The spell idea took me some time to understand. Iam still not sure if it was not too naive. But I don't regret the time for reading, which does not mean the story is better than 3 bodies problem.
第933条评论: This is one of the hardest books I've ever read, not just because of the Chinese Names, but the over whelming concepts that seem to round off the author's mind.  ALL WORTH IT!  I can't wait to get to the third book of this trilogy.  In this second book, mentally you not only leave the planet, but any concepts you have of the future.  ALL WORTH IT!!
第934条评论: Like the first novel, The Dark Forest focuses too much on sci-fi ideas than it does on characters. These ideas, which sometimes come and go without the development they really need, don't make for a compelling novel. When you have characters with even less depth, whom you can't really root for and are largely the same flat ideas, it makes you wish for a summary version to get it over with. It doesn't  help that this requires some of the most suspension of disbelief of any sci-fi novel I've read. Not because any of the ideas are so out there, but because the actions of everyone involved are so completely illogical. Creating a magical McGuffin to force things in a certain direction without merit is a sin unto itself, but having that same thing be used in completely non-sensical ways..
第935条评论: This is a five star read.  I haven't enjoyed a sci-fi novel this much since I started reading asimov in the 60's.
第936条评论: The first book was only just bearable. I only finished it because of the number of awards it had won. I thought, "this must pick up eventually?" No. Its trying too many things at once. I can't handle reading or watching a story that seems to just be the author telling you how smart they are. And the entire premise of the "cosmic sociologist" is absurd. At first I thought it was just a joke, but apparently not. I'd suggest reading "Children of Time" by Adrian Tchaikovsky if you're interested in human contact with another species with a different way of thinking and being. And it won't require such technical knowledge or the complete suspension of belief.
第937条评论: Loved the characters and learning the science behind the science fiction.Very well executed in spite of the fact that it is originally written in mandarin
第938条评论: Innovative at times and predictable at times.  Still a compelling read.
第939条评论: enjoying Chinese sci-fi
第940条评论: I like the interesting and unpredictable storyline. The trilogy is a must read for science fiction fans. The setup is quite original.
第941条评论: Brilliant concepts hung on the framework of a plot that is new, deeply non-formulaic and surprising.I sometimes read at the end of a day in preparation for going to sleep. The book totally failed me there.
第942条评论: An amazing science fiction novel that has instantly become my favorite. The scope and grandeur is incredible and the writing impeccable. No doubt about it, this is an amazing sequel for the Three Body Problem.
第943条评论: I loved the story, although the beginning and the end were less captivating as expected from the first book. The ideas and devolpment of the story were pretty good.
第944条评论: The aliens are alien  the second book seemed slow at places, but not unreasonably so. The references the Chinese history are also helpful.
第945条评论: Outstanding second volume of the trilogy.....hard to put down.  Author makes thousand pages that you cannot put down.
第946条评论: "Three Body Problem" was a slow start to this series, but patience pays in "The Dark Forest." If you're hesitating on buying the next book after  reading the first, don't.
第947条评论: Wow!  This is a Sci-fi masterpiece!  I couldn't put this book down. This will be a classic.  I can't wait to read Death's End!
第948条评论: Great science fiction with very sophisticated story telling.  Compelling reading.  Can't wait for the final installment in the trilogy.  Have already pre-ordered it!!!!
第949条评论: Great follow up to 1st book Sometimes hard to follow but very good
第950条评论: Even better than the first one and completely different.We move from the first contact to the next centuries and how humanity is transformed to face the alien threat.
第951条评论: found it hard to follow and slow going. to much of the novel was spent on the technical instead of character interactions.
第952条评论: Absolutely loved both books, the dark forest perhaps even more than 3 body - one of the best modern sf reads out there, I'd give it 6 stars if I could :)
第953条评论: This is one of the best scifi novels I've read in a long time.  His characters are amazing and his central thesis is thoughtful and well constructed.
第954条评论: Very good book.  The author assumes that the reader has some intelligence. It has a slow start but stay in there it is well worth the time.
第955条评论: This is not only a science fiction, but a book which can make you reconsider about the world and society. Very thoughtful
第956条评论: A great continuation of the series. Love the visions of humanity's future.
第957条评论: This is a short film made by fan of "The Dark Forest" as a salute to Liu Cixin, the infamous waterdrop:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uopk_XFBAP0
第958条评论: i just hope this book will overturn your understanding about the interstellar weapons.
第959条评论: Amazing! A must read book! Very interesting!
第960条评论: The translator has made dubious decisions to omit lines and paragraphs. Approximately 16% of the original contents were truncated as a result. If you pay close attention, some abridgements create issues in logical connections. The Chinese text makes more sense.
第961条评论: outstanding! amazing imagination! this book is worth reading. i'm looking forward to the third one!
第962条评论: One of the best sci-fi I have ever read. I like the big picture the author portrayed.
第963条评论: On the one hand it was enlightening to understand how someone born in a repressive country, indoctrinated in Communist ideology since childhood sees the world. However, I'd rather not repeat the experience. I'm just glad I don't live in a country that thinks so little of its people that it sends droves of "Political Commissars" to every primary and secondary school, college campus, business and military formation.In Europe and America books describing this level of political repression and societal manipulation are called fiction. In this writer's world it's just baked into the background of everyday life because, unfortunately it's not fiction in China. The failure and hopelessness of the Communist system is on full display as character's choose suicide over personal growth and optimism.I don't understand how this novel is rated higher than the Three-Body Problem! At least in the Three-Body Problem novel, the disaster of totalitarianism represented the antagonist it actually is. Hopelessness led the main character to betray the entire human race. No such lesson is evident in this book. Perhaps Chinese censors had more to say about this book after the Three-Body Problem won the Hugo Award. Obviously, this wasn't the point of the book, but it was impossible for me to enjoy the novel knowing that this part, at least, wasn't intended as fiction.
第964条评论: It's just too good
第965条评论: There is nothing more wonderful than a book that enthralls, entertains and broadens the mind and heart at the same time. The dark realization at the end of this novel contains its opposite, infinite hope. And I can think of nothing mankind needs more now than hope. I can't wait to read the third book in the trilogy, though I'm emotionally drained, in a good way, from this one. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who loves reading and who wants to be exposed to a sensibility a little different from our western one. It's wonderfully refreshing.
第966条评论: Wow, I read the first book, "The Three Body Problem" and enjoyed it, so I then read " The Dark Forest"  and enjoyed this one even more . Loved the way the story develops and blown away by the fantastic ending. Now Im looking forward to reading the final book in the trilogy.  I hadnt read Cixin Liu before, it can be difficult to find an author that writes the type of sci - fi that I like to read, but this guy is great. Check him out ...
第967条评论: Sometimes  a bit long winded but before you lose interest the story takes off in a suprising direction that quickly pulls you back in.
第968条评论: Everything goes through a cultural lens that makes me think of things in a different enough light that I get pleasantly caught off guard with character motivation  and plot twists.
第969条评论: The story is creative and has unexpected twists and turns.  The characters are developed well enough to evoke empathy and draw the reader in.  The story as a whole proceeds well despite some awkward patches.  It's hard to tell how much of the story's unique flavor is intrinsic to the original or a side effect of translation.  Either way, despite a few moments of disorientation it's a great story and well worth the effort of reading.
第970条评论: Very imaginative, but oh, there are long passages of unnecessary dialogue that can and should be skimmed. There's just too much extraneous writing, like the dark forest is purposely hiding the one tree in the forest they means anything.
第971条评论: What an incredible story. I have enjoyed this story like few others I've ever read. It is impossible to guess where the story is going, the author's ideas are very different from anything I know. Well worth reading, I look forward to reading the third book in this trilogy.
第972条评论: Awesome sequel to the 3-Body Problem!  A little slow start, but well worth  sticking with it.  I love the science aspect if this series, most Science fiction writers assume too much without explaining how it is possible in scientific terms.  I am really looking forward to the 3rd book which I understand will explore much more  in the development of the human and trisolarian cultures in the dark forest.
第973条评论: This was a difficult book to finish. The first book set up an insurmountable problem and this book had the task of thrusting the readers into the depths of utter despair. At times it really felt pointless, because no hope was in sight. But the author manages to deliver a fantastic high science tale of despair and resurgence and I can say that without one you couldn't have the other. Absolutely loved this, can't wait to dive into the last instalment. If you like real sci-fi, this is the series for you.
第974条评论: Absolutely breathtaking. The entire trilogy blew my mind with spectacular imagery and succinctly but accessibly described physics. If you havent read this trilogy, you are doing yourself a disservice.
第975条评论: This book is not written with the same eloquence as the Three Body Problem.  The difference is so striking it feels like this book is written by a different author.  In a way that is true because a different person translated this book.  While maybe a matter of personal taste, I felt the style of writing was much flatter here.  It bothered me enough to write this review before I finished the book.
第976条评论: I read this trilogy in Chinese. The Three Body Problem was just okay compared to the other two books. The story became very interesting from the Dark Forest. I could hardly put it down. However, in the third book, the author completely revealed his misogyny. In this trilogy, women were always the ones that led human to catastrophe, and men were always the heroes to protect human from being destroyed. This is the only and the most serious problem the trilogy had. The plot of the story is worth 5 stars. But more than 2 stars should be taken from the author's sexual discrimination.
第977条评论: In the best tradition of Arthur C. Clarke, David Brin, and Steven Baxter, both of the first two books in this trilogy (so far) embody a far-reaching imagination that is nevertheless well-grounded in plausible (though prodigious) projections from current scientific understanding. They also portray characters that are believable and well-rounded. Translation is clear and graceful (though it was sometimes difficult to keep track of all the different Chinese characters' names-- my personal problem as an American), and (evidently) true enough to the original to keep me conscious at all times that the setting is essentially Chinese and not Western.
第978条评论: This book surpasses the first book, The Three-Body Problem. I really liked the character Da Shi. The characters were less complex, but they were still equally as well developed. I liked how the mood changed from darkness in the first book to hopefulness in this book. I can't wait to read the third book in the trilogy!
第979条评论: The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu is a little more difficult to read than the first volume of the Three Body Problem series, but is still a thought provoking and imaginative description of life on earth in a future struggle with beings from another planet.If you read and enjoyed the first volume you have a good likelihood of enjoying this second volume. You can read this volume on it's own but I would advise reading the first book before you do so to get the most understanding of the background story.The book continues to provide more insights into Chinese world views and history, many insights into speculative science fiction and an imaginative description of what life might be like 200 years from now.This volume contains relatively little of the computer game reality that was a large part of the first book in the series.This book also continues the sometimes simplistic story-telling that reminds me of a detective story. This book also continues Cixin Liu's mode of having characters in the story carefully describe the science involved at different parts of the story. Characters in this book don't just pull out ray guns for example, the principals involved with the science are always explained along the way.Worth reading all the way to the end.
第980条评论: As my reviewer name suggests, Dune has been my all-time favorite science fiction series for decades now.After reading this book, I believe Cixin Liu has unseated Frank Herbert's work from that position. Put aside whatever else you're reading and get into this series now.
第981条评论: Hello readers who have finished The Dark Forest:if you love this book, you should definitely check out this video "WaterDrop": [http://www.project-57.org/]This is made by a TDF fan, and you are gonna love it. This is the favorite video approved by Cixin Liu, a must-watch.
第982条评论: I loved the 3 body Problem, and possibly liked the second book even more.  It manages to grow the universe of the story in a way that is dazzlingly big, and yet, the story is still straightforward and compelling.  Fantastic!
第983条评论: How can humanity survive the coming Trisolarian invasion without losing humanity? A beautiful novel with an uncertain , satisfactory but unsettling end
第984条评论: I'm thoroughly enjoying this series. Inventive, thoughtful, insightful.
第985条评论: Cixin Liu's second entry in his Remembrance of Earth's Past series continues his great work started with the Three-Body Problem. Complex ideas entwine with memorable characters to tell a story that's rooted in scientific principles but still exhibits the beauty and wonder of more fantastical Sci-Fi. Cixin Liu deserves the acclaim he's received. Joel Martinsen provides an engaging translation.
第986条评论: A very different book from "The Three-Body Problem", but mostly a worthy sequel. This time the narrative is rooted in future history and space battles, rather than physics and video games, but there are nevertheless plenty of original ideas and clever moments. There is a lot of unevenness in this book, and many slow passages that sap the freshness and excitement. But overall, it's an intriguing and satisfying read: bring on volume 3.
第987条评论: Contrary to the first book of this series, the plot is complex and book's no easy read. After finishing the book, I feel like I need to think over it and grasp the idea fully: Are we living in a dark forest? Scary...
第988条评论: even better than the first book of the trilogy. thoughful story dancing around the really big mysteries of science, the universe and life. recommended!
第989条评论: While I was intrigued by Mr. Liu's perspective in the first book, his tendency to deprecate religious values and the overall cynicism, while justified, became a bit hard to bear. The overall premise presented is a solid exposition on the ideal of assured destruction and societal reaction to it. I especially enjoyed the "dark forest" concept explained toward the end, though again, much more cynical than is traditional in the genre.
第990条评论: I usually don't leave reviews but I will make an exception for this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the trilogy but this second novel is just on another level. The different layers and interlocking stories, the overall conceits which drive the story, and the pacing and characterization are all top notch. This is just one of those books where you finish the last page and just put the book down and think. My only regret is that I finished this 6 months before the final part of the trilogy will be published in English. The wait will be unbearable.
第991条评论: Lovely books, two down one to go. Cixin kept true to the characters and makes a plausible situation. The teaser for book three absolutely hooked me.
第992条评论: Comparing to the Three Body Problem, this is a good sequel, but Cixin Liu left us with the bad habit of wanting more totally mind blowing new fiction, and, as I said, this is a sequel but not overtly inventive. Don't take me wrong, it is still very good.His writing style also is clearly more suited to sci-fi, *spoil alert* when he tries to describe a love scene between Luo Ji and Zhuang Yan he fails to demonstrate the same subtle, calm mastery we grow used to see displayed across the book. Despite these minor glitches still is a must read. Now let's see the next!
第993条评论: I think that book two (this one) was the strongest of the trilogy.  I'd almost recommend just stopping after this one, because I think the third book tries too hard to answer questions that don't need to be answered.This book found a better rhythm than both books 1 and 3, and the Wallfacers vs Wallbreakers plot is a fun one to watch unfold (and see how fickle the population and its leaders are).
第994条评论: My first journey to Chinese Sci-Fi and I was pleasantly surprised.  The translators seem to have done an excellent job with the title.  I was first put off by the concept of the story, but when I started I was kept intrigued to continue reading.  I enjoyed this as well as the second novel in the trilogy.
第995条评论: This book was even more enjoyable than the first one. Grand epic sci-fi at it's best. I am honored to make my knowledge with Chinese sci-fi from this series...... And let's hope Universe is not dark forest...
第996条评论: The Three Body Series is an excellent example of the universe building, centuries long narratives that were pioneered by Isaac Asimov. It’s captivating even in translation. I particularly have enjoyed learning more about Chinese society. It is a nice touch that Liu respectfully refers to as Azimov’s work in the text.
第997条评论: This is probably the weakest of the three books, but the exposition of the dark forest hypothesis alone makes it worth reading. As with his other books, the narrative style and the characters may feel at times a bit contrived or awkward to western readers, but Cixin Liu's imagination and apt leveraging of current concepts in physics more than compensates for the cultural gap.
第998条评论: Given my review for the first book (which I thought was terrible) you'd wonder why I would read the second book!  I am not sure either. Maybe a glutton for punishment. Or I felt I was missing something given how much praise it recieved.Anyway, this book is much better. His ideas are fantastic. The book moved much quicker and he is less prime to meaningless scientific exposition.  Execution is sometimes quite clunky and his characters feel very awkward. Again, the dialogue is woeful. His depiction of women is quite patriarchal.Good enough that I am interested in the third book.
第999条评论: A MUST read . Finished Three Body Problem and had to immediately continue on with this amazing and intellectually rich journey , with book 2 The Dark Forest. Intriguing with brilliant story line and thought provoking concepts , theory and science.  An incredible journey .... could not wait , just picked up book 3 Deaths End , I’m truly excited for what brilliance awaits me ....but I don’t want this fantastic journey to end .  For any hard science fiction reader ....this series is an absolute must .
第1000条评论: This is much better than Three Body Problem, but has its own flaws and doesn’t quite rate 5 stars. It moves along much quicker than it’s predecessor, but continues to repeat the same theme and variation pattern as the first one.If you made it through the first, this is definitely worth a read, as it has some of the coolest plot scenarios. I loved the Wallfacer stuff.
第1001条评论: This is book 2 of the Three Body series. I must admit that I have struggled with these books and I wonder if part of it is the cultural background of the author being so different from mine. The ideas are certainly different and this book picked up the pace from the first book. Still I have the final volume in hand and I have chosen to read another book before diving into the conclusion. That suggests that I am not totally engaged in the story. So - these books are not for everyone. If you want just to be entertained by a straight story, this may not fit the bill. If you want to work at it, you may enjoy it. Hopefully, the third book will bring things to a conclusion that is more satisfying. Right now - I'm ambivalent about the characters and the story.
第1002条评论: Cixin Liu's Dark Forest, the second in the series, started by "The Three Body Problem" provides a satisfying continuation of the plot and characters.  Readers will not be disappointed.  Cixin Liu doesn't rest on his laurels from the first book or the work done to develop the global setting that the story takes place in.  He uses these characters and the setting to keep readers moving through the plot to the conclusion of this book.  Can't wait for the third book in this series.
第1003条评论: Perhaps the best hard science fiction book and series I have read in years.  I actually had to go look up some of the terms and concepts for myself.  And I really enjoyed how the science was tightly integrated into the story - not merely has a backdrop for a human drama.  I have read very little Chinese literature, and it was interesting to learn about the role of political officers in military hierarchy.  Some very thought provoking and original concepts.
第1004条评论: I have read some incredible books in my life across many genres of fiction and non-fiction and this book and the first book in the trilogy stand with the very best. I feel so fortunate to have been told about it and to have stuck through some of the slow parts in the beginning of both books. Liu Cixin is a true master and I believe he will be revered in the future like Asimov and Tolkien and for the same reasons.
